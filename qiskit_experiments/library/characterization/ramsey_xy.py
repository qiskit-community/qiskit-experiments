    r"""A sign-sensitive experiment to measure the frequency of a qubit.

    # section: overview

        This experiment differs from the :class:`~qiskit_experiments.characterization.\
        t2ramsey.T2Ramsey` since it is sensitive to the sign of the frequency offset from
        the main transition. This experiment consists of following two circuits:

        .. parsed-literal::

            (Ramsey X) The second pulse rotates by pi-half around the X axis

                       ┌────┐┌─────────────┐┌───────┐┌────┐ ░ ┌─┐

                                                               0

            (Ramsey Y) The second pulse rotates by pi-half around the Y axis

                       ┌────┐┌─────────────┐┌───────────┐┌────┐ ░ ┌─┐
                  q_0: ┤ √X ├┤ Delay(τ[s]) ├┤ Rz(θ-π/2) ├┤ √X ├─░─┤M├
                       └────┘└─────────────┘└───────────┘└────┘ ░ └╥┘
            measure: 1/════════════════════════════════════════════╩═
                                                                   0

        The first and second circuits measure the expectation value along the -Y and X axes,
        respectively. This experiment therefore tracks the dynamics of the Bloch vector
        around the equator. The drive frequency of the control electronics defines a reference frame,
        which differs from the true qubit frequency by :math:`\Delta\omega`.
        The Hamiltonian during the
        ``Delay`` instruction is :math:`H^R = - \frac{1}{2} \Delta\omega` in the rotating frame,
        and the propagator will be :math:`U(\tau) = \exp(-iH^R\tau / \hbar)` where :math:`\tau` is the
        duration of the delay. By scanning this duration, we can get

        .. math::

            {\cal E}_x(\tau)
                = {\rm Re} {\rm Tr}\left( Y U \rho U^\dagger \right)
                &= - \cos(\Delta\omega\tau) = \sin(\Delta\omega\tau - \frac{\pi}{2}), \\
            {\cal E}_y(\tau)
                = {\rm Re} {\rm Tr}\left( X U \rho U^\dagger \right)
                &= \sin(\Delta\omega\tau),

        where :math:`\rho` is prepared by the first :math:`\sqrt{\rm X}` gate. Note that phase
        difference of these two outcomes :math:`{\cal E}_x, {\cal E}_y` depends on the sign and
        the magnitude of the frequency offset :math:`\Delta\omega`. By contrast, the measured
        data in the standard Ramsey experiment does not depend on the sign of :math:`\Delta\omega`,
        because :math:`\cos(-\Delta\omega\tau) = \cos(\Delta\omega\tau)`.

        The experiment also allows users to add a small frequency offset to better resolve
        any oscillations. This is implemented by a virtual Z rotation in the circuits. In the
        circuit above it appears as the delay-dependent angle θ(τ).
