    r"""An experiment to determine the optimal pulse amplitude by amplifying gate errors.

    # section: overview

        The :class:`FineAmplitude` experiment repeats N times a gate with a pulse
        to amplify the under-/over-rotations in the gate to determine the optimal amplitude.
        The circuits are therefore of the form:

        .. parsed-literal::

                       ┌──────┐       ┌──────┐ ░ ┌─┐
                  q_0: ┤ Gate ├─ ... ─┤ Gate ├─░─┤M├
                       └──────┘       └──────┘ ░ └╥┘
            measure: 1/═════════ ... ═════════════╩═
                                                  0

        Here, Gate is the name of the gate which will be repeated. The user can optionally add a
        square-root of X pulse before the gates are repeated. This square-root of X pulse allows
        the analysis to differentiate between over rotations and under rotations in the case of
        :math:`\pi`-pulses. Importantly, the resulting data is analyzed by a fit to a cosine function in
        which we try to determine the over/under rotation given an intended rotation angle per
        gate which must also be specified by the user.

        Error amplifying experiments are most sensitive to angle errors when we measure points along
        the equator of the Bloch sphere. This is why users should insert a square-root of X pulse
        before running calibrations for :math:`\pm\pi` rotations. When all data points are close to
        the equator, it is difficult for a fitter to infer the overall scale of the error. When
        calibrating a :math:`\pi` rotation, one can use ``add_xp_circuit = True`` to insert one
        circuit that puts the qubit in the excited state to set the scale for the other circuits.
        Furthermore, when running calibrations for :math:`\pm\pi/2` rotations users are advised
        to use an odd number of repetitions, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ...] to ensure that the ideal
        points are on the equator of the Bloch sphere. Note the presence of two repetitions which
        allows us to prepare the excited state. Therefore, ``add_xp_circuit = True`` is not needed
        in this case.
