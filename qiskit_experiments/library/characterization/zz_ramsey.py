    r"""An experiment to characterize the static :math:`ZZ` interaction for a qubit pair.

    # section: overview

        This experiment assumes a two qubit Hamiltonian of the form

        .. math::

            H = h \left(\frac{f_0}{2} ZI + \frac{f_1}{2} IZ + \frac{f_{ZZ}}{4} ZZ\right)

        and measures the strength :math:`f_{ZZ}` of the :math:`ZZ` term.
        :math:`f_{ZZ}` can be described as the difference between the frequency
        of qubit 0 when qubit 1 is excited and the frequency of qubit 0 when
        qubit 1 is in the ground state. Because :math:`f_{ZZ}` is symmetric in
        qubit index, it can also be expressed with the roles of 0 and 1
        reversed.  Experimentally, we measure :math:`f_{ZZ}` by performing
        Ramsey sequences on qubit 0 with qubit 1 in the ground state and again
        with qubit 1 in the excited state. The standard Ramsey experiment
        consists of putting a qubit along the :math:`X` axis of Bloch sphere,
        waiting for some time, and then measuring the qubit project along
        :math:`X`. By measuring the :math:`X` projection versus time the qubit
        frequency can be inferred. See
        :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.T2Ramsey` and
        :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RamseyXY`.

        Because we are interested in the difference in qubit 0 frequency
        between the two qubit 1 preparations rather than the absolute
        frequencies of qubit 0 for those preparations, we modify the Ramsey
        sequences (the circuits for the modified sequences are shown below).
        First, we add an X gate on qubit 0 to the middle of the Ramsey delay.
        This would have the effect of echoing out the phase accumulation of
        qubit 0 (like a Hahn echo sequence as used in
        :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.T2Hahn`), but we
        add a simultaneous X gate to qubit 1 as well.  Flipping qubit 1 inverts
        the sign of the :math:`f_{ZZ}` term. The net result is that qubit 0
        continues to accumulate phase proportional to :math:`f_{ZZ}` while the
        phase due to any ZI term is canceled out. This technique allows
        :math:`f_{ZZ}` to be measured using longer delay times than might
        otherwise be possible with a qubit with a slow frequency drift (i.e.
        the measurement is not sensitive to qubit frequency drift from shot to
        shot, only to drift within a single shot).

        The resulting excited state population of qubit 0 versus delay time
        exhibits slow sinusoidal oscillations (assuming :math:`f_{ZZ}` is
        relatively small). To help with distinguishing between qubit decay and
        a slow oscillation, an extra Z rotation is applied before the final
        pulse on qubit 0. The angle of this Z rotation is set proportional to
        the delay time of the sequence. This angle proportional to time behaves
        similarly to measuring at a fixed angle with the qubit rotating at a
        constant frequency. This virtual frequency is common to the two qubit 1
        preparations. By looking at the difference in frequency fitted for the
        two cases, this virtual frequency (called :math:`f` in the circuits
        shown below) is removed, leaving only the :math:`f_{ZZ}` value. The
        value of :math:`f` in terms of the experiment options is
        ``num_rotations / (max(delays) - min(delays))``.

        This experiment consists of the following two circuits repeated with
        different ``delay`` values.
