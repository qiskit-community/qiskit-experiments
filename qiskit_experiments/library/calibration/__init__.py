.. currentmodule:: qiskit_experiments.library.calibration

.. warning::
    The calibrations interface is still in active development. It may have
    breaking API changes without deprecation warnings in future releases until
    otherwise indicated.

Calibrating qubit setups is the task of finding the pulse shapes and parameter
values that maximizes the fidelity of the resulting quantum operations. This
therefore requires experiments which are analyzed to extract parameter values.
Furthermore, the resulting parameter values and schedules must be managed. The
calibration module in Qiskit experiments allows users to run calibration
experiments and manage the resulting schedules and parameter values.

The following experiments are designed to calibrate parameter values. Some experiments such
as :class:`QubitSpectroscopy` can both be seen as characterization and calibrations
experiments. Such experiments can be found in the
:mod:`qiskit_experiments.library.characterization`
module.
