            deprecated, update ``since`` to the new version.

            For example, "Instead, use the function ``new_func`` from the module
            ``<my_module>.<my_submodule>``, which is similar but uses GPU acceleration."

        removal_timeline: How soon can this deprecation be removed? Expects a value
            like "no sooner than 6 months after the latest release" or "in release 9.99".
        is_property: If the deprecated function is a `@property`, set this to True so that the
            generated message correctly describes it as such. (This isn't necessary for
            property setters, as their docstring is ignored by Python.)
