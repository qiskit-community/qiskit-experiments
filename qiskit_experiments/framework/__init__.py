.. currentmodule:: qiskit_experiments.framework

Overview
========

The experiment framework broadly defines an experiment as the execution of one or more
circuits on a device, and analysis of the resulting measurement data
to return one or more derived results.

The interface for running an experiment is through the ``Experiment`` classes subclassed from
:class:`.BaseExperiment`, such as those contained in the :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library`. The
following pseudo-code illustrates the typical workflow in Qiskit Experiments for

- Initializing a new experiment
- Running the experiment on a backend
- Saving result to an online database (for compatible providers)
- Viewing analysis results

.. code-block:: python

    # Import an experiment
    from qiskit_experiments.library import SomeExperiment

    # Initialize with desired qubits and options
    exp = SomeExperiment(physical_qubits, **options)

    # Run on a backend
    exp_data = exp.run(backend)

    # Wait for execution and analysis to finish
    exp_data.block_for_results()

    # Optionally save results to database
    exp_data.save()

    # View analysis results
    for result in exp_data.analysis_results():
        print(result)

The experiment class contains information for generating circuits and analysis
of results. These can typically be configured with a variety of options.
Once all options are set, you can call the :meth:`.BaseExperiment.run` method to run
the experiment on a Qiskit compatible ``backend``.

The steps of running an experiment involves generation experimental circuits
according to the options you set and submission of a job to the specified
``backend``. Once the job has finished executing an analysis job performs
data analysis of the experiment execution results.

The result of running an experiment is an :class:`ExperimentData` container
which contains the analysis results, any figures generated during analysis,
and the raw measurement data. These can each be accessed using the
:meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_results`, :meth:`.ExperimentData.figure`
and :meth:`.ExperimentData.data` methods respectively. Additional metadata
for the experiment itself can be added via :meth:`.ExperimentData.metadata`.
