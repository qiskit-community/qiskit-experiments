    Composite experiments consist of several component experiments
    run together in a single execution, the results of which are returned
    as a single list of circuit result data in the :class:`ExperimentData`
    container.

    Analysis of this composite circuit data involves constructing
    a list of experiment data containers for each component experiment containing
    the marginalized circuit result data for that experiment. These are saved as
    :meth:`~.ExperimentData.child_data` in the main :class:`.ExperimentData` container.
    Each component experiment data is then analyzed using the analysis class from
    the corresponding component experiment.

    .. note::

        If the composite :class:`ExperimentData` does not already contain child
        experiment data containers for the component experiments they will be
        initialized and added to the experiment data when
        :meth:`~.CompositeAnalysis.run` is called on the composite data.

        When calling :meth:`~.CompositeAnalysis.run` on experiment data already
        containing initialized component experiment data, any previously stored circuit
        data will be cleared and replaced with the marginalized data from the composite
        experiment data.
