    # section: overview

    A plotter takes data from an experiment analysis class or experiment and plots a
    given figure using a drawing backend. Sub-classes define the kind of figure created
    and the expected data.

    Data is split into series and supplementary data. Series data is grouped by series
    name (``Union[str, int, float]``). For :class:`CurveAnalysis`, this is the model
    name for a curve fit. For series data associated with a single series name and
    supplementary data, data values are identified by a data key (str). Different data
    per series and figure must have a different data key to avoid overwriting values.
    Experiment and analysis results can be passed to the plotter so appropriate graphics
    can be drawn on the figure canvas. Series data is added to the plotter using
    :meth:`set_series_data` whereas supplementary data is added using
    :meth:`set_supplementary_data`. Series and supplementary data are retrieved using
    :meth:`data_for` and :attr:`supplementary_data` respectively.

    Series data contains values to be plotted on a canvas, such that the data can be
    grouped into subsets identified by their series name. Series names can be thought of
    as legend labels for the plotted data, and as curve names for a curve fit.
    Supplementary data is not associated with a series or curve and is instead only
    associated with the figure. Examples include analysis reports or other text that is
    drawn onto the figure canvas.

    .. rubric:: Options and Figure Options

    Plotters have both :attr:`options` and :attr:`figure_options` available to set
    parameters that define how to plot and what is plotted. :class:`BaseDrawer` is
    similar in that it also has ``options`` and ``figure_options``. The former contains
    class-specific variables that define how an instance behaves. The latter contains
    figure-specific variables that typically contain values that are drawn on the
    canvas, such as text.

    For example, :class:`BasePlotter` has an ``axis`` option that can be set to the
    canvas on which the figure should be drawn. This changes how the plotter works in
    that it changes where the figure is drawn. :class:`BasePlotter` has an ``xlabel``
    figure option that can be set to change the text drawn next to the X-axis in the
    final figure. As the value of this option will be drawn on the figure, it is a
    figure option.

    As plotters need a drawer to generate a figure, and the drawer needs to know what to
    draw, figure options are passed to :attr:`drawer` when the :meth:`figure` method is
    called. Any figure options that are defined in both the plotters
    :attr:`figure_options` attribute and the drawers ``figure_options`` attribute are
    copied to the drawer: i.e., :meth:`BaseDrawer.set_figure_options` is called for each
    common figure option, setting the value of the option to the value stored in the
    plotter.

    .. note::
        If a figure option called "foo" is not set in the drawer's figure options
        (:attr:`BaseDrawer.figure_options`) but is set in the plotter's figure options
        (:attr:`figure_options`), it will not be copied over to the drawer when the
        :meth:`figure` method is called. This means that some figure options from the
        plotter may be unused by the drawer. :class:`BasePlotter` and its subclasses
        filter these options before setting them in the drawer, as subclasses of
        :class:`BaseDrawer` may add additional figure options. To make validation
        easier and the code cleaner, the :meth:`figure` method conducts this check
        before setting figure options in the drawer.

    .. rubric:: Example
