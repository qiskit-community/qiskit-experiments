class BaseCalibrationExperiment(BaseExperiment, ABC):
    """A mixin class to create calibration experiments.

    This abstract class extends a characterization experiment by turning it into a
    calibration experiment. Such experiments allow schedule management and updating of an
    instance of :class:`.Calibrations`. Furthermore, calibration experiments also specify
    an auto_update variable which, by default, is set to True. If this variable,
    is True then the run method of the experiment will call :meth:`~.ExperimentData.block_for_results`
    and update the calibrations instance once the backend has returned the data.

    This mixin class inherits from the :class:`.BaseExperiment` class since calibration
    experiments by default call :meth:`~.ExperimentData.block_for_results`. This ensures that the next
    calibration experiment cannot proceed before the calibration parameters have been
    updated. Developers that wish to create a calibration experiment must subclass this
    base class and the characterization experiment. Therefore, developers that use this
    mixin class must pay special attention to their class definition. Indeed, the first
    class should be this mixin and the second class should be the characterization
    experiment since the run method from the mixin must be used. For example, the rough
    frequency calibration experiment is defined as

    .. code-block:: python

        RoughFrequencyCal(BaseCalibrationExperiment, QubitSpectroscopy)

    This ensures that the ``run`` method of :class:`.RoughFrequencyCal` will be the
    run method of the :class:`.BaseCalibrationExperiment` class. Furthermore, developers
    must explicitly call the :meth:`__init__` methods of both parent classes.

    Developers should strive to follow the convention that the first two arguments of
    a calibration experiment are the qubit(s) and the :class:`.Calibrations` instance.

    If the experiment uses custom schedules, which is typically the case, then
    developers may chose to use the :meth:`get_schedules` method when creating the
    circuits for the experiment. If :meth:`get_schedules` is used then the developer
    must override at least one of the following methods used by :meth:`get_schedules`
    to set the schedules:

    #. :meth:`_get_schedules_from_options`

    #. :meth:`_get_schedules_from_calibrations`

    #. :meth:`_get_schedules_from_defaults`

    These methods are called by :meth:`get_schedules`.

    The :meth:`update_calibrations` method is responsible for updating the values of the parameters
    stored in the instance of :class:`.Calibrations`. Here, :class:`BaseCalibrationExperiment`
    provides a default update methodology that subclasses can override if a more elaborate behaviour
    is needed. At the minimum the developer must set the variable :code:`_updater` which
    should have an :code:`update` method and can be chosen from the library
    :mod:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.update_library`. See also
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.update_library.BaseUpdater`. If no updater
    is specified the experiment will still run but no update of the calibrations will be performed.
