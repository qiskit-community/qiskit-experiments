    Fixed  :class:`~.ExperimentData` not inferring the  credentials for the IBM
    experiment service from a :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService`
    instance as it used to do for ``qiskit-ibm-provider``. Previously, the IBM
    experiment service was set up in the :class:`~.ExperimentData` constructor,
    but now it is done on first attempt to use the service, allowing more time
    for the service to be set explicitly or for other attributes to be set that
    help with inferring the credentials.

    Fixed a bug where :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` would not work when
    passed a single :class:`qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult` object.

    Added classes
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseJob`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExtendedJob`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.Job`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseProvider`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.IBMProvider`, and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.Provider` to document the interfaces
    needed by :class:`~.ExperimentData` to work with jobs and results.
