features:
  - |
    A new class :class:`.LayerFidelityUnitary` which allows for layer style RB with arbitrary
    two-qubit gates or circuits in the 2Q layer was added. A list of qiskit :class:`qiskit.circuit.Gate` 
    or :class:`qiskit.circuit.CircuitInstruction` objects can be passed into the class and then each layer is 
    randomly sampled from that list. A final SU(2) inversion gate is appended so that the full 
    circuit is the identity and this is analyzed using the same
    :class:`.LayerFidelityAnalysis` analysis class as :class:`.LayerFidelity`.

fixes:
  - |
    The validation function for both :class:`.LayerFidelityUnitary` and
    :class:`.LayerFidelity` was updated to fix a slowdown for :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>` versions
    less than 0.40.0
