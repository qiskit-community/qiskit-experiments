    Added a class :class:`.LayerFidelityUnitary` which allows for layer style RB with arbitrary
    two-qubit gates or circuits in the 2Q layer. A list of qiskit :class:`.Gate` 
    or :class:`.CircuitInstruction` objects can be passed into class and then each layer is 
    randomly sampled from that list. A final SU(2) inversion gate is appended so that the full 
    circuit is the identity and this is analyzed using the same analysis class 
    :class:`.LayerFidelityAnalysis`.
