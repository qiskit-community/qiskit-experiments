  - |
    A new data processing node :class:`.data_processing.DiscriminatorNode` is added. This node
    wraps a pre-trained discriminator so that discrimination can be built
    into the data processing chain. The discriminator node is initialialized
    from a discriminator or list thereof which are objects that must have a
    predict method ``predict(x) -> y``  as is common in SKlearn. Here,
    :code:`x` is a list of IQ points and :code:`y` are the labels assigned to
    each point.
    
  - |
    A new data processing node :class:`.data_processing.RestlessToIQ` is added to 
    process restless level one data, i.e., IQ data, in addition to the existing abstract
    :class:`.data_processing.RestlessNode` and :class:`.data_processing.RestlessToCounts`
    for processing restless counts.
