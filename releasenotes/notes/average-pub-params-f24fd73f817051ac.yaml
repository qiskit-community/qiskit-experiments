    Enable averaging PUB parameters in :class:`~.ExperimentData` when 
    the circuit metadata contain "average_params". This feature is undocumented
    for now since it is niche. It requires the user to submit parameterized
    circuits to a sampler outside of an experiment and then add the results to
    an :class:`.ExperimentData` object since Qiskit Experiments does not
    currently support running parameterized PUBs directly.
