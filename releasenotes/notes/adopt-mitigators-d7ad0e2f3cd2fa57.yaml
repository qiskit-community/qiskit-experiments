features:
  - |
    New :class:`~.LocalReadoutMitigator` and
    :class:`~.CorrelatedReadoutMitigator` classes have been added. These
    classes were moved directly from Qiskit which deprecated them in Qiskit
    1.3. They provide utility methods for applying readout error mitigation and
    integrate with the readout error mitigation experiments
    :class:`~.LocalReadoutError` and :class:`~.CorrelatedReadoutError`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The readout error mitigation experiments :class:`~.LocalReadoutError` and
    :class:`~.CorrelatedReadoutError` have been updated to generate instances
    of the new :class:`~.LocalReadoutMitigator` and
    :class:`~.CorrelatedReadoutMitigator` classes. The experiments should
    continue to work as before, but any code that was using, for example,
    ``isinstance()`` to check object type would need to be updated to check
    against the Qiskit Experiments classes instead of the old Qiskit classes.
