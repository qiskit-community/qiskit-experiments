    :class:`.ScatterTable` is introduced as a drop-in replacement of :class:`.CurveData`.
    
    This is a data format to store intermediate data in curve analysis, built on top of
    the pandas DataFrame. Each table row corresponds to a single data point, 
    and the table contains all data points generated by the :class:`.CurveAnalysis`.
    All properties and methods of :class:`.CurveData` are implemented for backward compatibility,
    but these will be removed in the future release.
  - |
    New analysis option ``fit_category`` is added to :class:`.Curveanalysis` subclasses.
    This option controls which data subset within the :class:`.ScatterTable` 
    is used for the curve fitting.
developer:
  - |
    :meth:`.CurveAnalysis._create_figures` method is added to the curve analysis base class.
    A curve analysis subclass can overwrite this method to customize the output figures.
    The method is called with the :class:`.ScatterTable` containing all intermediate data points 
    generated during the curve analysis.
