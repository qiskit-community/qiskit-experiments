deprecations:
  - |
    Experiments involving pulse gate calibrations have been deprecated, due to
    the upcoming `deprecation of Qiskit Pulse in Qiskit 2.0
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13063>`_. These experiments
    include ``QubitSpectroscopy``, ``EFSpectroscopy``, ``Rabi``, ``EFRabi``,
    ``ResonatorSpectroscopy``, ``RoughDrag``, ``StarkRamseyXY``,
    ``StarkRamseyXYAmpScan``, ``StarkP1Spectroscopy``,
    ``CrossResonanceHamiltonian``, ``EchoedCrossResonanceHamiltonian``,
    ``RoughFrequencyCal``, ``RoughEFFrequencyCal``, ``FrequencyCal``,
    ``FineFrequencyCal``, ``RoughDragCal``, ``FineXDragCal``,
    ``FineSXDragCal``, ``FineDragCal``, ``FineAmplitudeCal``,
    ``FineXAmplitudeCal``, ``FineSXAmplitudeCal``, ``HalfAngleCal``,
    ``RoughAmplitudeCal``, ``RoughXSXAmplitudeCal``, and
    ``EFRoughXSXAmplitudeCal``.

    Also due to the deprecation of Qiskit Pulse, support for providing pulse
    gate calibrations to excite higher levels has been deprecated from
    :class:`.MultiStateDiscrimination`.
  - |
    The ``Calibrations`` class and all of Qiskit Experiments' calibration
    support is deprecated. The calibrations features were based on adjusting
    parameters of pulses used in gates. With the deprecation of Qiskit Pulse,
    these features are now also deprecated.
  - |
    Support for running experiments in restless mode using the
    ``RestlessMixin`` is deprecated. With improvements in the reliability of
    IBM Quantum's qubit initialization, circuit exectuion has already become
    reasonably fast and restless measurements do not add much performance
    improvement. It is expected that the restless features are little used as
    there has been no recent user feedback about them.
