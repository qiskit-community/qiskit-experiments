    In this release we added support for the Qiskit primitives.
    Qiskit Experiments will execute circuits using :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2` by default. 
upgrade:
  - |
    When only a ``backend`` is set on an experiment, :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment.run`
    now defaults to wrapping the ``backend`` in a :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2` and
    using that to execute the circuits. A new ``sampler`` argument is also
    accepted by ``run()`` to allow for a custom :class:`qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2`
    instance to be used for circuit execution. ``run()`` also accepts a ``backend_run``
    option which will cause the old ``backend.run`` path to be used for circuit execution.
    However, the ``backend.run()`` method is scheduled to be removed from
    qiskit-ibm-runtime in the near future.
