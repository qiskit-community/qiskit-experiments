    For benchmarking classes (such as :class:`.LayerFidelity`) that use the
    helper methods of :class:`.CliffordUtils`,
    a synthesis option was added to decompose the 1Q cliffords into
    a fixed gate structure using the syntax
    ``rb_obj.experiment_options.clifford_synthesis_method = '1Q_fixed'``
    using :class:`qiskit.synthesis.OneQubitEulerDecomposer`
