prelude: >
    The Qiskit Experiments 2.0 release includes several bug fixes and
    improvements and many new experiments added to the
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library`. Added experiments include a full suite
    of single-qubit gate calibration and characterization experiments, and
    two-qubit Cross-resonance Hamiltonian characterization experiments.

    There are also numerous changes and improvements to the base classes in
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.framework` and
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management` to make
    developing new experiments easier, to improve JSON serialization, and to 
    improve storing and loading experiments for the IBM experiment database
    service.
features:
  - |
    You can now change the default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated
    figures by setting
    ``qiskit_experiments.framework.matplotlib.default_figure_canvas`` to the
    desired canvas. Note that it has to be a canvas for one of the
    `non-interactive backend
    <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#the-builtin-backends>`_.
    For example, you can set ``default_figure_canvas`` to
    :class:`~matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg` to use the
    ``AGG`` backend.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated figures was changed
    from `AGG` to `SVG`.
  - |
    Due to changes in JSON serialization it is possible that some experiments
    saved to the IBM Experiments database service using the Qiskit Experiments
    0.1 API may not be able to be loaded using Qiskit Experiments 0.2.
developer:
  - |
    Adds hooks for serialization and deserialization of custom classes to
    the JSON :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentEncoder`
    and :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentDecoder`.
    To enable serialization classes must implement a method
    ``__json_encode__(self) -> Any`` that returns a JSON serializable object,
    and a class method ``_json_decode__(cls, value: Any)__ -> cls`` that can
    reconstruct the object from the JSON deserialized value.
