upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated support for running experiments with restless
    measurements has been removed. The ``RestlessMixin`` class has been removed
    from the package and thus has also been removed from classes like
    :class:`.RamseyXY` and :class:`.StandardRB` on which it was previously
    applied.
deprecations:
  - |
    The data processing nodes :class:`.RestlessNode`,
    :class:`.RestlessToCounts`, and :class:`.RestlessToIQ` have been
    deprecated. These deprecations follow on the removal of ``RestlessMixin``
    and complete the deprecation of restless measurement code from
    qiskit-experiments. In principle, users may copy the code of these
    deprecated nodes and use it to create a custom restless data processor for
    use on experiments even without support in the base Qiskit Experiments
    package.
