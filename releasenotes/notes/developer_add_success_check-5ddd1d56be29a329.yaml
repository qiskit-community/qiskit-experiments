    The :py:func:`assertExperimentDone` function has been added to
    :py:class:`test.base.QiskitExperimentsTestCase`. This assertion will check
    if all threads in the experiment data are successfuly completed.
    This function calls :meth:`block_for_results` and then checks if the experiment
    status returns ``DONE`` after execution. It is `highly recommended` to use this test
    right after each experiment execution to detect program malfunction,
    which is paticularly relevant to python multi-threading in multi-platform.
