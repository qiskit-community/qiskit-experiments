    With the impending deprecation of the ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` package, support for
    ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` is now deprecated and will be removed
    in the next release. Users should migrate to :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>` following the
    `runtime migration guide
    <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime-from-provider>`_.
    :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>` is not listed as a dependency for compatibility reasons, but users
    will need it to run experiments on IBM backends.
