    The :class:`.FineFrequency` experiment was modified so that it no longer sets
    the ``basis_gates`` in its transpile options to default to the gates used
    in its ``circuits()`` method. If these gates were already in the backend's
    target, there should be no change in behavior. If the gates were not in the
    backend's target, then the experiment would have been producing transpiled
    circuits that did not match the backend's instruction set and so would not
    run. The ``basis_gates`` setting was a remnant from the previous support
    for pulse calibrations for which the calibration experient would use the
    ``basis_gates`` option to know which pulse gate calibrations to attach to
    the circuits.
