fixes:
  - |
    Fix a bug where :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_cliffords` always returned a single Clifford
    ignoring the ``size`` arguments. Now it returns a list of Cliffords with ``size``.
  - |
    Fix a bug where both :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_cliffords` and
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_clifford_circuits` with integer ``seed``
    returned a list of the same circuits (sampled with a common seed).
    Now it returns a list of circuits sampled with different seeds.
deprecations:
  - |
    Two helper methods of :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_cliffords` and
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_clifford_circuits` have been deprecated.
other:
  - |
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit` (and :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit_circuit`)
    changed its mapping between integers and 2Q Cliffords.
    That means 2Q RB experiments may sample different set of circuits from before
    even if exactly the same arguments are used for their construction.
