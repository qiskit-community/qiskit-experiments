    Fixed a bug in EPG (error per gate) computation in :class:`~.RBAnalysis`
    where it fails with a ``TypeError`` for backends with ECR gate
    as a 2-qubit basis gate (e.g. IBM Eagle processors).
    See
    `#1419
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/1419>`_.
    for the details of the bug.
