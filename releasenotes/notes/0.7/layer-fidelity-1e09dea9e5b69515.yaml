    Add a new experiment class :class:`.LayerFidelity` to measure
    `layer fidelity and EPLG (error per layered gate) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05933>`_,
    which is a holistic benchmark to characterize the full quality of the devices at scale.

    It has an experimental feature: its :meth:`circuits`
    exceptionally returns circuits on physical qubits (not virtual qubits as usual).
    Its analysis class :class:`.LayerFidelityAnalysis` returns :class:`.AnalysisResultData`
    which contains several ``extra`` entries to help additional analyses: e.g.
    ``qubits`` to ease the query of sub-analysis results and
    ``reason`` to tell users why the ``quality`` of the analysis was ``"bad"``.

    For example, the syntax for pulling out the individual fidelities looks like below.

    .. code-block:: python
    
      df = exp_data.analysis_results(dataframe=True)
      df[(df.name=="ProcessFidelity") & (df.qubits==(59, 60))].value

    See `an example notebook
    <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-device-benchmarking/blob/main/notebooks/layer_fidelity.ipynb>`_
    for more examples such as how to select a best possible qubit chain to measure and
    how to plot EPLG as a function of (sub)chain length.
