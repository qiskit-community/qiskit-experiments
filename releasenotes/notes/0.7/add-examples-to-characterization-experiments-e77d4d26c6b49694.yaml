    Added minimal working code examples to many experiment API pages,
    especially characterization experiments. The minimal working code example
    is a code snippet which users can copy and paste to run the experiment.
    Users are required to specify a backend to use the code example. By default,
    the backend used in the examples is a simulator such as ``FakeManilaV2``.
