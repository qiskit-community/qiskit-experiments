    Several deprecated modules, methods, functions, and options have been removed and will no longer work:

    * The visualization module of :mod:`.CurveAnalysis` has been replaced by the
      standalone :mod:`.visualization` module. The ``LegacyCurveCompatDrawer`` has
      been removed from :mod:`.visualization`.
    * The ``curve_drawer`` option to :class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis` has been
      replaced by the plotter in the visualization module.
    * The ``SeriesDef`` dataclass has been removed and replaced by the ``LMFIT`` module.
    * The ``CurveData`` dataclass has been removed and replaced by :class:`.ScatterTable`'s DataFrame representation.
    * ``random_cliffords()`` and ``random_clifford_circuits()`` have been
      removed from :class:`.CliffordUtils` and replaced by :meth:`.StandardRB.__sample_sequence`.
    * ``beta`` has been renamed to ``outcome_prior`` in the tomography utility
      function ``binomial_weights()``.
    * The ``return_data_points`` option has been removed from curve analysis.
      Data points are now automatically provided in :class:`.ExperimentData` objects via the ``curve_data``
      artifact.
    * The default value of ``flatten_results`` in composite experiments has changed to ``True``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Accessing experiment data artifacts by numerical index has been
    deprecated. Use the name or ID of the artifact instead.
issues:
  - |
    Fit parameters are not populated in composite curve analysis results and are
    found only in the fit summary artifact. In a future release, they will be 
    removed from all analysis result objects and live in the artifacts only.
