features:

    Added an option to plot residuals for single-figure experiments, which is enable by setting ``plot_residuals`` to ``True``.

    Introduced ``sub_plot_heights_list`` and ``sub_plot_widths_list`` attributes in :class:`.PlotStyle` for customizable 
    subplot sizes where each list needs to sum up to 1. This feature currently works only for experiments with
    no subplots.
