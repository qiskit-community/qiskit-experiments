  The Qiskit Experiments 0.9.0 release primarily provides compatibility
  with version 2.0 of the [Qiskit SDK](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit). A
  major change is the removal the previously deprecated support for pulse
  experiments and calibration due to the removal of Qiskit Pulse in Qiskit 2.0.
  Some other smaller changes were also needed to adapt to Qiskit 2.0 as
  described below. Additionally, previously deprecated code related curve
  fitting and restless measurements was removed. Some additional code paths
  have been marked as deprecated, particularly relating to
  :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_results` as described below.
