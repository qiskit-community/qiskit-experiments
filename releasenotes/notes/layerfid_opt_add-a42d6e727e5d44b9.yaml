    :class:`.LayerFidelity` has two new options, ``layer_barrier`` and ``min_delay``.
    ``layer_barrier`` turns off the barrier between all qubits in the layer,
    so that layer run becomes simultaneous direct RB. ``min_delay`` allows the
    user to enforce a minimum delay during the two-qubit layer using a qubit
    that is not part of the two-qubit gate list. Also added the EPL
    (error per layer) calculation to the layer analysis output and to the figure.
