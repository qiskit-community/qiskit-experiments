    :class:`.LayerFidelity` now filters out non-standard one qubit gates from
    the target when choosing the set to use for transpiling the one qubit
    Clifford gates. Previously, it would use all one qubit gates in the
    backend's target. With Qiskit 2.0, transpiling with a non-standard gate in
    the way that :class:`.LayerFidelity` does leads to an exception. A warning
    is emitted if a non-standard one qubit gate is filtered out.
