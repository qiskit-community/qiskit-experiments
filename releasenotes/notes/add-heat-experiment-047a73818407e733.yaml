  - |
    New experiment module :mod:`qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian`
    has been added. This module collects experiments to characterize low level
    system properties, such as device Hamiltonian.

    The `Hamiltonian Error Amplifying Tomography` (HEAT) experiment has been
    added. This experiment consists of the base class
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.BatchHeatHelper`
    and :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.HeatElement`
    class for experiment developers to implement their own HEAT experiment
    for arbitrary generator and for specific interrogated error axis.
    This can be realized by designing proper initialization circuit,
    echo sequence, and measurement axis against the interrogated error axis.

    The HEAT experiment specific to the ZX-type generator
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZXHeat` is also added
    along with pre-configured experiments for
    X (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatXError`),
    Y (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatYError`),
    Z (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatZError`)
    error axis. These experiments are typically used to characterize
    the Cross Resonance gate Hamiltonian implementing the CNOT gate.
