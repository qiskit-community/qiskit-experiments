upgrade:
  - |
    Curve analysis utility functions
    ``filter_data``,
    ``mean_xy_data``, ``multi_mean_xy_data``, and
    :func:`.data_sort` deprecated in 0.9 have been
    removed. These methods were written to work with the previous
    representation of curve data. Curve analysis now works with
    ``ScatterTable`` which provides a ``filter`` method which can be used
    with functions like :func:`.shot_weighted_average` to achieve similar
    results to the deprecated functions.
  - |
    The ``.ScatterTable` properties ``data_allocation`` and
    ``labels`` and method ``get_subset_of`` deprecated in 0.9 have been removed.
    ``data_allocation`` was renamed to ``series_id``. ``labels`` can be found
    by looking at the ``series_name`` of the scatter table's ``dataframe``.
    Data subsets can be obtained using ``ScatterTable.filter`` in place of
    ``get_subset_of``.
  - |
    The data processing nodes ``RestlessNode``,
    ``RestlessToCounts``, and ``RestlessToIQ`` deprecated in 0.9 have been
    deprecated. Qiskit Experiments no longer has restless measurement support
    code, though it still supports custom data processing nodes which could be
    designed to process restless measurements.
  - |
    ``FineZXAmplitude`` deprecated in 0.9 has been removed. Since it relied on
    a uncommon gate, (``RZX(pi/2)``), it was difficult to use without pulse
    gate calibrations which are no longer supported with Qiskit 2.0.
  - |
    ``PulseBackend`` and ``SingleTransmonTestBackend`` deprecated in 0.9 have been
    removed. These backend classes used `Qiskit Dynamics
    <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-dynamics>`_ to simulate quantum
    circuits using Qiskit Pulse with pulse-level simulation and were mainly
    intended for testing purposes. With the removal of pulse features in Qiskit
    2.0, these classes could no longer be maintained.
