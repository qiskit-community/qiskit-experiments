features:
  - |
    Curve analysis helper functions :class:`.utils.inverse_weighted_variance`,
    :class:`.utils.sample_weighted_average`, and
    :class:`.utils.shot_weighted_average` were documented as public. These
    functions were present in previous releases but not documented as public.
deprecations:
  - |
    Curve analysis utility functions
    :func:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.utils.filter_data`,
    :func:`.mean_xy_data`, :func:`.multi_mean_xy_data`, and
    :func:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.utils.data_sort`` have been
    deprecated. These methods were written to work with the previous
    representation of curve data. Curve analysis now works with
    :class:`.ScatterTable` which provides a ``filter`` method which can be used
    with functions like :func:`.shot_weighted_average` to achieve similar
    results to the deprecated functions.
  - |
    The :class:`.ScatterTable` properties ``data_allocation`` and
    ``labels`` and method ``get_subset_of``have been deprecated.
    ``data_allocation`` was renamed to ``series_id``. ``labels`` can be found
    by looking at the ``series_name`` of the scatter table's ``dataframe``.
    Data subsets can be obtained using :meth:`.ScatterTable.filter` in place of
    ``get_subset_of``.
