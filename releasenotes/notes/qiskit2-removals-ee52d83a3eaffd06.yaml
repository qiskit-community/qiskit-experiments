features:
  - |
    Classes :class:`.MeasLevel` and :class:`.MeasReturnType` were added to
    enumerate the supported measurement levels (kerneled or classified) and
    return types (averaged or not) for the results of jobs run by experiments.
    Previously, private classes of Qiskit were inadvertently used for these
    purposes but they were removed in Qiskit 2.0.
upgrade:
  - |
    In preparation for Qiskit 2.0, references to ``BackendV1`` have been
    guarded so that they do not cause import errors. ``BackendV1`` is still
    supported for now, but support will be removed in a future release.
  - |
    :class:`.LocalReadouMitigator` now provides a more specific warning if it
    is used with a backend without a ``properties()`` method or with a backend
    that does not the require readout error properties.
  - |
    :class:`.ExperimentData` was updated to handle changes to
    :class:`qiskit.result.Result` in Qiskit 2.0. With Qiskit 2.0, the result
    header is a dict instead of a custom class. Qiskit Experiments uses this
    header to store metadata about experiments' circuits and now handles both
    the dict and class forms.
  - |
    A performance issue in :class:`.QuantumVolume` was addressed. When Qiskit
    Aer is installed, :class:`.QuantumVolume` uses
    :class:`qiskit_aer.AerSimulator` to simulate the outcomes of the quantum
    volume circuits to determine the heavy output probabilities. In its default
    instantiation, ``AerSimulator`` regenerates its
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.Target` every time it is accessed and this
    generation takes an appreciable amount of time. Because the target was
    being accessed separately for every circuit, this overhead could accumulate
    to over a minute in the standard 100 circuit experiment. This overhead was
    reduced by processing all the circuits in one pass.
deprecations:
  - |
    Support for using ``BackendV1`` with Qiskit Experiments is deprecated. Some
    code paths will generate warnings when using ``BackendV1`` but not all
    cases are checked. Support is planned to be removed along all support for
    Qiskit 1 in a future release near the end of support for Qiskit 1.4.
