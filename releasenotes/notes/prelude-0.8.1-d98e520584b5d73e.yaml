    Qiskit Experiments 0.8.1 is a minor update to 0.8.0 to improve
    compatibility with dependencies Qiskit and CVXPY. References to code in
    these dependencies were updated to avoid triggering deprecation warnings, so
    that the code will continue to work as new versions of Qiskit and CVXPY are
    released. Additional examples were added to the documentation, and some
    typos were corrected.
