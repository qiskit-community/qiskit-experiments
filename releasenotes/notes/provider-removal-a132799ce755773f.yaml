    All references to ``qiskit.providers.Provider`` have been removed the code
    base. The provider base classes were deprecated in Qiskit 1.1 with planned
    removal in Qiskit 2.0. Qiskit Experiments has some support code for working
    with providers to retrieve job data, but it takes the provider object as
    input. The only explicit references to the provider classes were in type
    annotations and test support code under ``qiskit_experiments.test``. The
    type annotations have been removed and the test code now uses its own class
    without a parent.
