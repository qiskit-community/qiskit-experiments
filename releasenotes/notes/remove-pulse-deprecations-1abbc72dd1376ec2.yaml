upgrade:
  - |
    Previously deprecated experiments involving pulse gate calibrations have
    been removed, due to the upcoming `removal of Qiskit Pulse in Qiskit
    2.0 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13063>`_. These experiments
    include ``QubitSpectroscopy``, ``EFSpectroscopy``, ``Rabi``, ``EFRabi``,
    ``ResonatorSpectroscopy``, ``RoughDrag``, ``StarkRamseyXY``,
    ``StarkRamseyXYAmpScan``, ``StarkP1Spectroscopy``,
    ``CrossResonanceHamiltonian``, ``EchoedCrossResonanceHamiltonian``,
    ``BaseCalibrationExperiment``,
    ``RoughFrequencyCal``, ``RoughEFFrequencyCal``, ``FrequencyCal``,
    ``FineFrequencyCal``, ``RoughDragCal``, ``FineXDragCal``,
    ``FineSXDragCal``, ``FineDragCal``, ``FineAmplitudeCal``,
    ``FineXAmplitudeCal``, ``FineSXAmplitudeCal``, ``HalfAngleCal``,
    ``RoughAmplitudeCal``, ``RoughXSXAmplitudeCal``, and
    ``EFRoughXSXAmplitudeCal``. The associated analysis and helper classes like
    ``ResonanceAnalysis``, ``CrossResonanceHamiltonianAnalysis``,
    ``DragCalAnalysis``, ``ResonatorSpectroscopyAnalysis``, and
    ``StarkCoefficients`` were also removed.

    Also due to the deprecation of Qiskit Pulse, support for providing pulse
    gate calibrations to excite higher levels has been removed from
    :class:`.MultiStateDiscrimination`.
  - |
    The ``Calibrations`` class and all of Qiskit Experiments' calibration
    support (including gate libraries and calibration updaters and experiments)
    has been removed. The calibrations features were based on adjusting
    parameters of pulses used in gates. With the removal of pulse support in
    Qiskit 2.0, it no longer was feasible to keep support for features that
    rely on pulse gate  calibrations.
  - |
    The methods of :class:`.BackendData` and :class:`.BackendTiming` that
    involved pulse gate features have been removed. The removed methods were
    ``control_channel``, ``drive_channel``, ``measure_channel``,
    ``acquire_channel``, ``min_length``, ``pulse_alignment``,
    ``acquire_alignment``, ``drive_freqs``,  and ``meas_freqs`` of
    ``BackendData`` and ``round_pulse`` and ``pulse_time`` of
    ``BackendTiming``.
  - |
    The ability for :class:`.ExperimentEncoder` and :class:`.ExperimentDecoder`
    to work with the pulse ``ScheduleBlock`` class has been removed.
  - |
    ``qiskit-dynamics`` has been removed from the ``extras`` extra of the
    package. This means that ``pip install qiskit-experiments[extras]`` will no
    longer install ``qiskit-dynamics``. :class:`.PulseBackend` and
    :class:`.SingleTransmonTestBackend` still require ``qiskit-dynamics`` to be
    installed, so it must be installed separately. The reason for this change
    is that Qiskit Experiments aims to keep compatibility with the latest
    Qiskit and so will not require a package that pins the Qiskit version while
    Qiskit Dynamics plans to pin to Qiskit version 1.

deprecation:
  - |
    :class:`.FineZXAmplitude` has been deprecated. It was not deprecated along
    with the other pulse-related experiments in the previous Qiskit Experiments
    release, but it requires an ``ZX`` rotation of :math:`\pi / 2` which is not
    easily realizable on any known providers without pulse calibrations.

  - |
    :class:`.PulseBackend` and :class:`.SingleTransmonTestBackend` have been
    deprecated. These backend classes use `Qiskit Dyanmics
    <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-dynamics>`_ to simulate quantum
    circuits using Qiskit Pulse with pulse-level simulation and were mainly
    intended for testing purposes. With the removal of pulse features in Qiskit
    2.0, these classes can no longer be maintained. Their deprecation was
    missed in the previous round of pulse feature deprecation. While the
    classes are kept for one more release cycle, they require Qiskit less than
    2.0 in order to function.
