    Qiskit Experiments 0.11.0 introduces new device benchmarking features,
    namely a new layer fidelity variant (:class:`.LayerFidelityUnitary`) and a
    new Clifford synthesis option for the various benchmarking experiments. It
    also removes several previously deprecated functions and classes and
    provides some minor fixes and changes in behavior.
