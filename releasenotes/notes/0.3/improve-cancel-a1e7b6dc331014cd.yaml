fixes:
  - |
    Fixed some issues with :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel_analysis`
    and :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel` to make cancelling analysis
    callbacks more robust.
  - |
    Fixed :meth:`.ExperimentData.block_for_results` to handle blocking
    in recursive cases where an analysis callback adds another
    job or analysis callback.
