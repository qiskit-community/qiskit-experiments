    The Qiskit Experiments 0.3 release includes several bug fixes and
    improvements and several new experiments added to the
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library`. Added experiments include readout error, resonator spectroscopy, 
    two-qubit fine amplitude, and several characterization experiments. Experiments can 
    now be run restlessly without resetting.

    There are also numerous changes and improvements to the :class:`.BaseExperiment`,  
    :class:`.ExperimentData`, and composite experiment classes to improve JSON serialization, 
     handling of metadata, accessing the status of jobs and experiments, and the 
    storing and loading of experiments to and from the IBM experiment database service.
