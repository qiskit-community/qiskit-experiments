upgrade:
  - |
    The signature of the ``outcome_data`` argument of the tomography
    fitter functions in :mod:`.library.tomography` has been changed from
    a list of NumPy ndarray vectors of non-zero observed frequencies into a
    single ndarray matrix containing the observed frequencies of all possible
    measurement outcomes for the measurement bases.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in :class:`.TomographyAnalysis` where the basis elements of
    unobserved measurement outcomes were not being included in the fitter
    objective function for least-squares fitters (CVXPY and SciPy).
    This would lead to lower than expected fit fidelities when fitting data
    with many zero count outcomes (typically synthetic data from ideal simulation).
  - |
    Fixed issue with the CVXPY :class:`.ProcessTomography` analysis fitter
    functions :func:`.cvxpy_linear_lstsq` and :func:`cvxpy_gaussian_lstsq`
    where the trace preserving constraint was not being applied to the fit
    functions by default and required being explicitly passed as a
    ``solver_option``. Now all CVXPY process tomography experiments will
    have this option set to True by default unless a user explicitly
    disables it by setting the solver_option to False.
