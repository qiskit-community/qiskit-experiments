features:
  - |
    Added a ``flatten_results`` init kwarg to :class:`.CompositeAnalysis`,
    :class:`.CompositeExperiment`, :class:`.ParallelExperiment`, and
    :class:`.BatchExperiment` that if set to ``True`` flattens all analysis
    results and figures from component experiment analysis into the main
    :class:`.ExperimentData` container, and does not save the individual
    child data components.

    Note that for nested composite experiments setting ``flatten_results=True``
    will recursively set the same value for all component experiments that
    are also composite experiments.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed the :class:`.Tphi` experiment and :class:`.TphiAnalysis` to combine
    the component analysis results so that it runs as a single experiment
    returning :math:`T_\phi`, :math:`T_1`, and :math:`T_2^\ast` analysis results.
