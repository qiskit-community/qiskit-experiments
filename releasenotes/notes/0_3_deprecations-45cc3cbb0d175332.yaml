  - |
    Several deprecated methods and options have been removed and will no longer work:
      
    * :meth:`.BaseExperiment.set_analysis_options` has been removed and should be 
      replaced with `.BaseAnalysis.set_options`.
    * The ``curve_plotter`` option for :meth:`.CurveAnalysis.set_options` has been 
      removed and replaced with ``curve_drawer``.
    * The ``curve_fitter`` option for :meth:`.CurveAnalysis.set_options` has been 
      removed, now you can directly override :meth:`~CurveAnalysis._run_curve_fit` 
      instead.
    * Setting ``style`` and drawer options with :meth:`.CurveAnalysis.set_options`
      has been disabled. Analyses should use ``drawer.set_options`` instead.
    * The `FitVal` class has been removed and replaced with the uncertainties package.
    * Boolean values for the analysis kwarg in :meth:`.BaseExperiment.run` have 
      been disabled. Use `analysis=default` instead of `analysis=True`, and 
      analysis=None instead of `analysis=False`.
    * :meth:`.BaseExperiment.run_analysis` has been removed. Use 
      :meth:`.BaseAnalysis.run` instead.
    * :meth:`.BaseExperiment._postprocess_transpiled_circuits` is removed. Use 
      :meth:`.BaseExperiment._transpiled_circuits` instead.
    * :meth:`.BaseExperiment.set_analysis_options` method has been deprecated, use 
      the :meth:`.BaseAnalysis.set_options` method for the experiments analysis 
      class instead.   
    * The ``timeout`` kwarg of :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` has been removed.
      Timeout for adding jobs is now handled by the :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_jobs`
      method.
    * Adding data from jobs using :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` has been
      disabled. This method should now only be used to add data from Qiskit
      :class:`.Result` objects or raw data dicts. Job data should now be added 
      using :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_jobs` instead.
