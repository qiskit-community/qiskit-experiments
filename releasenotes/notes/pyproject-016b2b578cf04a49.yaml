    The Python package configuration has been moved from ``setup.py`` to
    ``pyproject.toml``. As part of this move, the separate requirements files
    have also been moved into ``pyproject.toml``. See the ``CONTRIBUTING.md``
    file in the `source repository
    <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-experiments>`__ for information
    on setting up a development environment if not using ``tox`` (which should
    continue working the same way).
