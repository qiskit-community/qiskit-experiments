    Updated querying of :class:`~qiskit.providers.Backend` metadata to support
    the look up of qubit T1 and measurement drive frequency, in order to
    support :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV2` backends. The look up of the
    latter is ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` specific. This change fixes errors
    failing to find these properties when using :class:`.ResonatorSpectroscopy`
    (issue `#1099 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/issues/1099>`_)
    and when using restless measurements with ``BackendV2`` backends.
