features:
  - |
    The :class:`.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` experiment and its subclass now accept
    ``durations`` with default values. Note that values should be provided in
    units of seconds rather than samples, and must include pulse ramps at edges.
    Default values with linear increment are generated according to new experiment options,
    ``min_duration``, ``max_duration``, and ``num_durations``, when the durations
    are not explicitly provided. The default values are chosen by assuming a
    ZX rate of around 1 MHz which is typical for IBM Quantum backends.
    User can update these option values as well as provide full ``durations``
    to tailor experiment settings to their device.
    Total durations should be carefully chosen not to overflow the waveform memory
    when the experiment is run on a real hardware. With this update, 
    the minimum example code to run this experiment might be
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      from qiskit_experiments.library.characterization import CrossResonanceHamiltonian
      
      expr = CrossResonanceHamiltonian(qubits=(0, 1), amp=0.3, backend=backend)
      exp_data = expr.run()
    
    where the durations to scan are implicitly set by experiment options.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``flat_top_widths`` argument and experiment option of 
    :class:`.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` experiment and its subclass 
    have been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit Experiments 0.6.
fixes:
  - |
    There has been a bug in the :class:`.EchoedCrossResonanceHamiltonian` experiment 
    in which the Hamiltonian coefficients were overestimated by a factor of 2.
    This bug has been fixed.
