    Improved the performance of circuit generation in 1Q/2Q randomized benchmarking experiments (about 10x speedup).
    That is mainly achieved by the following two updates in their implementation:

    * Custom transpilation of circuits (mapping circuits to physical qubits without using transpile),
    
    * Integer-based Clifford operations (especially sparse lookup table with triplet decomposition
      for 2Q Clifford circuits).
