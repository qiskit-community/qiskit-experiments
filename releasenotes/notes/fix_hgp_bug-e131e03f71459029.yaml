upgrade:
  - |
    The automatic retrieval of hub, group, and project information from a
    backend for storage in an :class:`~.ExperimentData` instance has been
    removed  as these properties are no longer a part of the access model in
    the new IBM Quantum Platform on IBM Cloud. The new model has instances with
    "plans" and "names" but these do not map directly to the hub, group, and
    project information. Currently, no attempt is made to capture this
    information in an equivalent way.

fixes:
  - |
    As described in the Upgrade Notes, automatic retrieval of hub, group, and
    project information is no longer attempted when the backend is set on an
    :class:`~.ExperimentData` instance. Avoiding this retrieval avoids an
    exception being raised when working with
    :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>` version 0.41
    which changed the behavior of the interface that had been used for
    accessing the hub, group, and project information.
