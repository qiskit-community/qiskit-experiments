    A new ``benchmark_suffix`` argument for the :class:`~.LayerFidelity`
    and :class:`~.LayerFidelityUnitary` classes has been added which enables
    users to append a descriptive suffix to the names of the analysis results in
    these experiments, which makes bookkeeping for different types of gates easier.
