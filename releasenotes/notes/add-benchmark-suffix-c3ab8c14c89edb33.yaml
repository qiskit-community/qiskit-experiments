    Qiskit Experiments 0.12 introduces a new option for labeling results of
    layer fidelity experiments. Additionally, it addresses an incompatibility
    with :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>` version
    0.41 that prevents experiments from running.
features:
  - |
    A new ``benchmark_suffix`` argument for the :class:`~.LayerFidelity`
    and :class:`~.LayerFidelityUnitary` classes has been added which enables
    users to append a descriptive suffix to the names of the analysis results in
    these experiments, which makes bookkeeping for different types of gates easier.
