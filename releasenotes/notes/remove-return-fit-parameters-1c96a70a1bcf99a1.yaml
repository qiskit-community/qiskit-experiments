  - |
    The deprecated analysis option ``return_fit_parameters`` has been removed
    from :class:`.CurveAnalysis` and :class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis`. This
    change means that the fit parameter analysis result that started with
    ``@Parameters`` will no longer be included in the set of analysis results.
    Code calling :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_results` with a numerical
    index, rather than a result name or using ``dataframe=True`` (the
    recommended pattern) may find a different result than it did before. Fit
    parameters should be accessed using :meth:`.ExperimentData.artifacts` to
    retrieve the ``fit_parameters`` artifact.
