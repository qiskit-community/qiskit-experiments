T2 Hahn Characterization
========================

The purpose of the :math:`T_2` Hahn Echo experiment is to determine the 
:math:`T_2` qubit property.

In this experiment, we would like to get a more precise estimate of the qubitâ€™s decay
time. :math:`T_2` represents the amount of time required for a single qubit's Bloch
vector projection on the XY plane to fall to approximately 37% (:math:`\frac{1}{e}`) of
its initial amplitude. Unlike :math:`T_2^*`, which is measured by :class:`.T2Ramsey`,
:math:`T_2` is insensitive to inhomogenous broadening. Hahn Echo experiment and the
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence are experiments to estimate :math:`T_2` which
are robust to the detuning frequency, or the difference between the qubit frequency and
the pulse frequency of the applied rotation. The decay in amplitude causes the
probability function to take the following form:

.. math:: f(t) = A \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{T_2}}+ B

The difference between the Hahn Echo and CPMG sequence is that in the Hahn Echo
experiment, there is only one echo sequence while in CPMG there are
multiple echo sequences.

Decoherence Time
----------------

The decoherence time is the time taken for off-diagonal components of the
density matrix to fall to approximately 37% (:math:`\frac{1}{e}`). For
:math:`t\gg T_2`, the qubit statistics behave like a random bit, with
value 0 with probability of :math:`p` and value 1 with probability :math:`1-p`.

Since the qubit is exposed to other types of noise (like T1), we are
using :math:`R_x(\pi)` pulses for decoupling and to solve our inaccuracy
for the qubit frequency estimation.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import qiskit
    from qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.t2hahn import T2Hahn

The circuit used for an experiment with :math:`N` echoes comprises the
following components:

#. :math:`R_x\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right)` gate
#. :math:`N` times echo sequence:

   #. :math:`Delay \left(t_{0} \right)` gate
   #. :math:`R_x \left(\pi \right)` gate
   #. :math:`Delay \left(t_{0} \right)` gate

#. :math:`R_x \left(\pm \frac{\pi}{2} \right)` gate (sign depends on the number of echoes)
#. Measurement gate

The user provides as input a series of delays in seconds. During the
delay, we expect the qubit to precess about the z-axis. Because of the
echo gate (:math:`R_x(\pi)`) for each echo, the angle after the delay
gates will be :math:`\theta_{new} = \theta_{old} + \pi`. After waiting
the same delay time, the angle will be approximately :math:`0` or
:math:`\pi`. By varying the extension of the delays, we get a series of
decaying measurements. We can draw the graph of the resulting function
and can analytically extract the desired values.

.. jupyter-execute::

    qubit = 0
    conversion_factor = 1e-6 # our delay will be in micro-sec
    delays = list(range(0, 50, 1) )
    delays = [float(_) * conversion_factor for _ in delays]
    number_of_echoes = 1
    
    # Create a T2Hahn experiment. Print the first circuit as an example
    exp1 = T2Hahn(physical_qubits=(qubit,), delays=delays, num_echoes=number_of_echoes)
    print(exp1.circuits()[0])


We run the experiment on a simple simulated backend tailored
specifically for this experiment.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_experiments.test.t2hahn_backend import T2HahnBackend
    
    estimated_t2hahn = 20 * conversion_factor
    # The behavior of the backend is determined by the following parameters
    backend = T2HahnBackend(
        t2hahn=[estimated_t2hahn],
        frequency=[100100],
        initialization_error=[0.0],
        readout0to1=[0.02],
        readout1to0=[0.02],
    )

The resulting graph will have the form:
:math:`f(t) = A \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{T_2}}+ B` where *t* is the delay and
:math:`T_2` is the decay factor.

.. jupyter-execute::

    exp1.analysis.set_options(p0=None, plot=True)
    expdata1 = exp1.run(backend=backend, shots=2000, seed_simulator=101)
    expdata1.block_for_results()  # Wait for job/analysis to finish.
    
    # Display the figure
    display(expdata1.figure(0))

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Print results
    for result in expdata1.analysis_results():
        print(result)


Providing initial user estimates
--------------------------------

The user can provide initial estimates for the parameters to help the
analysis process. In the initial guess, the keys ``{amp, tau, base}``
correspond to the parameters ``{A, T_2, B}`` respectively. Because the
curve is expected to decay toward :math:`0.5`, the natural choice for
parameter :math:`B` is :math:`0.5`. When there is no :math:`T_2` error,
we would expect that the probability to measure ``1`` is :math:`100\%`,
therefore we will guess that A is :math:`0.5`. In this experiment,
``t2hahn`` is the parameter of interest. Good estimate for it is the
value computed in previous experiments on this qubit or a similar value
computed for other qubits.

.. jupyter-execute::

    exp_with_p0 = T2Hahn(physical_qubits=(qubit,), delays=delays, num_echoes=number_of_echoes)
    exp_with_p0.analysis.set_options(p0={"amp": 0.5, "tau": estimated_t2hahn, "base": 0.5})
    expdata_with_p0 = exp_with_p0.run(backend=backend, shots=2000, seed_simulator=101)
    expdata_with_p0.block_for_results()
    
    # Display fit figure
    display(expdata_with_p0.figure(0))

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Print results
    for result in expdata_with_p0.analysis_results():
        print(result)



Number of echoes
----------------

The user can provide the number of echoes that the circuit will perform.
This will determine the amount of delay and echo gates. As the number of
echoes increases, the total time of the circuit will grow. The echoes
decrease the effects of :math:`T_{1}` noise and frequency inaccuracy
estimation. Due to that, the Hahn Echo experiment improves our estimate
for :math:`T_{2}`. In the following code, we will compare results of the
Hahn experiment with ``0`` echoes and ``1`` echo. The analysis should
fail for the circuit with ``0`` echoes. In order to see it, we will add
frequency to the qubit and see how it affect the estimated :math:`T_2`.
The list ``delays`` is the times provided to each delay gate, not the
total delay time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    
    qubit2 = 0
    # set the desired delays
    conversion_factor = 1e-6
    
    # The delays aren't equally spaced due the behavior of the exponential
    # decay curve where the change in the result during earlier times is 
    # larger than later times. In addition, since the total delay is 
    # 'delay * 2 * num_of_echoes', the construction of the delays for 
    # each experiment will be different such that their total length
    # will be the same.
    
    # Delays for Hahn Echo Experiment with 0 echoes
    delays2 = np.append(
                        (np.linspace(0.0, 51.0, num=26)).astype(float),
                        (np.linspace(53, 100.0, num=25)).astype(float),
                    )
    
    delays2 = [float(_) * conversion_factor for _ in delays2]
    
    # Delays for Hahn Echo Experiment with 1 echo
    delays3 = np.append(
                        (np.linspace(0.0, 25.5, num=26)).astype(float),
                        (np.linspace(26.5, 50, num=25)).astype(float),
                    )  
    delays3 = [float(_) * conversion_factor for _ in delays3]
    
    num_echoes = 1
    estimated_t2hahn2 = 30 * conversion_factor
    
    # Create a T2Hahn experiment with 0 echoes
    exp2_0echoes = T2Hahn((qubit2,), delays2, num_echoes=0)
    exp2_0echoes.analysis.set_options(p0={"amp": 0.5, "tau": estimated_t2hahn2, "base": 0.5})
    print("The first circuit of hahn echo experiment with 0 echoes:")
    print(exp2_0echoes.circuits()[0])
    
    # Create a T2Hahn experiment with 1 echo. Print the first circuit as an example
    exp2_1echoes = T2Hahn((qubit2,), delays3, num_echoes=num_echoes)
    exp2_1echoes.analysis.set_options(p0={"amp": 0.5, "tau": estimated_t2hahn2, "base": 0.5})
    print("The first circuit of hahn echo experiment with 1 echo:")
    print(exp2_1echoes.circuits()[0])
    


.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_experiments.test.t2hahn_backend import T2HahnBackend
    
    detuning_frequency = 2 * np.pi * 10000
    
    # The behavior of the backend is determined by the following parameters
    backend2 = T2HahnBackend(
        t2hahn=[estimated_t2hahn2],
        frequency=[detuning_frequency],
        initialization_error=[0.0],
        readout0to1=[0.02],
        readout1to0=[0.02],)
    
    # Analysis for Hahn Echo experiment with 0 echoes.
    expdata2_0echoes = exp2_0echoes.run(backend=backend2, shots=2000, seed_simulator=101)
    expdata2_0echoes.block_for_results()  # Wait for job/analysis to finish.
    
    # Analysis for Hahn Echo experiment with 1 echo
    expdata2_1echoes = exp2_1echoes.run(backend=backend2, shots=2000, seed_simulator=101)
    expdata2_1echoes.block_for_results()  # Wait for job/analysis to finish.
    
    # Display the figure
    print("Hahn Echo with 0 echoes:")
    display(expdata2_0echoes.figure(0))
    print("Hahn Echo with 1 echo:")
    display(expdata2_1echoes.figure(0))


We see that the estimate :math:`T_2` is different in the two plots. The
mock backend for this experiment used :math:`T_{2} = 30[\mu s]`, which
is close to the estimate of the one echo experiment.
