Experiment Manuals
==================

These experiment manuals are in-depth dives into some individual experiments, their
operational principles, and how to run them in Qiskit Experiments. Note that the
experiments below are only a small fraction of the full list of experiments in
the :doc:`package library <../apidocs/library>`.

.. _verification manuals:

Verification Experiments
------------------------

These experiments measure and verify your device performance according to a set of
defined metrics, such as the space-time volume of circuits that can be successfully
executed.

Qubit Characterization Experiments
----------------------------------

These experiment measure specific properties of a qubit.

.. _measurement-related manuals:

Measurement-Related Experiments
-------------------------------

These experiments postprocess on measurement results to improve some aspect of a
quantum circuit, such as readout fidelity or run time.
