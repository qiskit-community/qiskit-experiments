Writing your own experiment
===========================

Qiskit Experiments is designed to be easily customizable. If you would like to 
run an experiment that's similar to an existing experiment in the 
:doc:`library </apidocs/library>`, you can subclass the existing experiment and analysis
classes. You can also write your own experiment class from the ground up by subclassing
the :class:`.BaseExperiment` class. We will discuss both cases in this tutorial.

Experiment subclassing
----------------------

In general, to subclass the :class:`.BaseExperiment` class, you should:

- Implement the abstract :meth:`.BaseExperiment.circuits` method.
  This should return a list of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects defining
  the experiment payload.

- Call the :meth:`.BaseExperiment.__init__` method during the subclass
  constructor with a list of physical qubits. The length of this list must
  be equal to the number of qubits in each circuit and is used to map these
  circuits to this layout during execution.
  Arguments in the constructor can be overridden so that a subclass can
  be initialized with some experiment configuration.

Optionally, to allow configuring experiment and execution options, you can override:

- :meth:`.BaseExperiment._default_experiment_options`
  to set default values for configurable option parameters for the experiment.

- :meth:`.BaseExperiment._default_transpile_options`
  to set custom default values for the :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` method used to
  transpile the generated circuits before execution.

- :meth:`.BaseExperiment._default_run_options`
  to set default backend options for running the transpiled circuits on a backend.

- :meth:`.BaseAnalysis._default_options`
  to set default values for configurable options for the experiment's analysis class.

- :meth:`.BaseExperiment._transpiled_circuits`
  to override the default transpilation of circuits before execution.

- :meth:`.BaseExperiment._metadata`
  to add any experiment metadata to the result data.

.. note::

    Qiskit Experiments supports experiments on non-qubit components defined as subclasses of
    :class:`.DeviceComponent`, such as the :class:`.Resonator` in the :class:`.ResonatorSpectroscopy`
    experiment. If you would like to work on these components in your experiment, you should override
    ``_metadata()`` to populate ``device_components`` with these components. Here is
    an example for an experiment that takes in :class:`.Resonator` components:

    .. jupyter-input::

        from qiskit_experiments.database_service import Resonator

        def _metadata(self):
            """Add the custom resonator components to the metadata."""
            metadata = super()._metadata()
            metadata["device_components"] = list(map(Resonator, self.physical_qubits))
            return metadata

Furthermore, some characterization and calibration experiments can be run with restless
measurements, i.e. measurements where the qubits are not reset and circuits are executed
immediately after the previous measurement. Here, the :class:`.RestlessMixin` class
can help to set the appropriate run options and data processing chain.

Analysis subclassing
--------------------

To create an analysis subclass, one only needs to implement the abstract
:meth:`.BaseAnalysis._run_analysis` method. This method takes an
:class:`.ExperimentData` container and kwarg analysis options. If any
kwargs are used, the :meth:`.BaseAnalysis._default_options` method should be
overriden to define default values for these options. You can also write a custom
analysis class for an existing experiment class and then run ``exp.analysis = NewAnalysis()``
after instantiating the experiment object ``exp`` to override its default analysis class.

The :meth:`.BaseAnalysis._run_analysis` method should return a pair
:code:`(results, figures)`, where ``results`` is a list of
:class:`.AnalysisResultData` objects and ``figures`` is a list of
:class:`matplotlib.figure.Figure` objects.

The :doc:`Data Processor <data_processor>` module contains classes for
building data processor workflows to help with advanced analysis of
experiment data.

If you want to customize the figures of the experiment, consult the 
:doc:`Visualization tutorial </tutorials/visualization>`.


Custom experiment template
--------------------------

Here is a barebones template to help you get started with customization:

.. jupyter-input::

    from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
    from typing import List, Optional, Sequence
    from qiskit.providers.backend import Backend
    from qiskit_experiments.framework import BaseExperiment, Options

    class CustomExperiment(BaseExperiment):
        """Custom experiment class template."""

        def __init__(self, 
                     physical_qubits: Sequence[int], 
                     backend: Optional[Backend] = None):
            """Initialize the experiment."""
            super().__init__(physical_qubits, 
                             analysis = CustomAnalysis(),
                             backend = backend)

        def circuits(self) -> List[QuantumCircuit]:
            """Generate the list of circuits to be run."""
            circuits = []
            # Generate circuits and populate metadata here
            for i in loops:
                circ = QuantumCircuit(self.num_qubits)
                circ.metadata = {}
                circuits.append(circ)
            return circuits

        @classmethod
        def _default_experiment_options(cls) -> Options:
            """Set default experiment options here."""
            options = super()._default_experiment_options()
            options.update_options(
                dummy_option = None,
            )
            return options

Notice that when we called ``super().__init__``, we provided the list of physical
qubits, the name of our analysis class, and the backend, which is optionally specified
by the user at this stage.

The corresponding custom analysis class template:

.. jupyter-input::

    import matplotlib
    from typing import Tuple, List
    from qiskit_experiments.framework import (
        BaseAnalysis, 
        Options, 
        ExperimentData, 
        AnalysisResultData
    )

    class CustomAnalysis(BaseAnalysis):
        """Custom analysis class template."""

        @classmethod
        def _default_options(cls) -> Options:
            """Set default analysis options. Plotting is on by default."""

            options = super()._default_options()
            options.dummy_analysis_option = None
            options.plot = True
            options.ax = None
            return options

        def _run_analysis(
            self, 
            experiment_data: ExperimentData
        ) -> Tuple[List[AnalysisResultData], List["matplotlib.figure.Figure"]]:
            """Run the analysis."""

            # Process the data here

            analysis_results = [
                AnalysisResultData(name="dummy result", value=data)
            ]
            figures = []
            if self.options.plot:
                figures.append(self._plot(data))
            return analysis_results, figures

Now we'll use what we've learned so far to make an entirely new experiment using
the :class:`.BaseExperiment` template.






Example custom experiment: randomized measurement
-------------------------------------------------

Symmetrizing the measurement readout error of a circuit is especially useful in systems 
where readout has an unknown and potentially large bias. We can create an experiment 
using the Qiskit Experiments framework to take a circuit as an input and symmetrize
its readout.

To do so, our experiment should create a list of copies of the input circuit
and randomly sample an :math:`N`-qubit Pauli to apply to each one, then add
a final :math:`N`-qubit :math:`Z`-basis measurement to randomize the expected
ideal output bitstring in the measurement. The analysis uses the applied Pauli frame of 
a randomized measurement experiment to de-randomize the measured counts. The results
are then combined across samples to return a single counts dictionary for
the original circuit. This has the effect of Pauli twirling and symmetrizing the
measurement readout error.

To start, we write our own ``__init__()`` method to take as input the circuit that we
want to twirl on. We also want to give the user the option to specify which physical
qubits to run the circuit over, which qubits to measure over, the number of samples to
repeat, and the seed for the random generator. If the user doesn't specify these
options, we default the qubits to the list of qubits starting with 0 and up to the
length of the number of qubits in the circuit - 1 for both, and the number of samples
to 10.

.. jupyter-input::

    from numpy.random import default_rng, Generator
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit.quantum_info import random_pauli_list
    from qiskit_experiments.framework import BaseExperiment

    class RandomizedMeasurement(BaseExperiment):
    """Randomized measurement experiment."""
        def __init__(
            self,
            circuit,
            measured_qubits=None,
            physical_qubits=None,
            backend=None,
            num_samples=10,
            seed=None
        ):
            """Basic randomized Z-basis measurement experiment via a Pauli frame transformation
            
            Note this will just append a new set of measurements at the end of a circuit.
            A more advanced version of this experiment would be to use a transpiler pass to
            replace all existing measurements in a circuit with randomized measurements.
            """
            if physical_qubits is None:
                physical_qubits = tuple(range(circuit.num_qubits))
            if measured_qubits is None:
                measured_qubits = tuple(range(circuit.num_qubits))
            
            # Initialize BaseExperiment
            analysis = RandomizedMeasurementAnalysis()
            super().__init__(physical_qubits, analysis=analysis, backend=backend)
            
            # Add experiment properties
            self._circuit = circuit        
            self._measured_qubits = measured_qubits
            
            # Set any init options
            self.set_experiment_options(num_samples=num_samples, seed=seed)

Now we consider default experiment options. We choose to only let the user change
the number of samples and seed after instantiation by updating the experiment options.

.. jupyter-input::

    ...

        @classmethod
        def _default_experiment_options(cls):
            options = super()._default_experiment_options()
            options.num_samples = None
            options.seed = None
            return options


Now we write the ``circuits()`` method. We need to take the input circuit in
``self._circuit`` and add our random Paulis as well as measurement at the end. We use
the built-in property :attr:`~.BaseExperiment.num_qubits` of :class:`~.BaseExperiment`
to get the number of qubits in the experiment. We keep track of the list of qubits and
classical registers. Note that the circuits themselves are always built on qubits `0` to
`length of the circuit - 1`, and not the actual physical qubit indices given in
``physical_qubits``, as discussed in :doc:`getting_started`.

.. jupyter-input::

    ...


        def circuits(self):
            # Number of classical bits of the original circuit
            circ_nc = self._circuit.num_clbits

            # Number of added measurements
            meas_nc = len(self._measured_qubits)

            # Classical bits of the circuit
            circ_clbits = list(range(circ_nc))

            # Classical bits of the added measurements
            meas_clbits = list(range(circ_nc, circ_nc + meas_nc))

            # Qubits of the circuit
            circ_qubits = list(range(self.num_qubits))

            # Qubits of the added measurements
            meas_qubits = self._measured_qubits

            # Get number of samples from options
            num_samples = self.experiment_options.num_samples
            if num_samples is None:
                num_samples = 2 ** self.num_qubits
            
            # Get rng seed
            seed = self.experiment_options.seed
            if isinstance(seed, Generator):
                rng = seed
            else:
                rng = default_rng(seed)
            
            paulis = random_pauli_list(meas_nc, size=num_samples, phase=False, seed=rng)

In the last line of the above code block, we used the 
:func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.random_pauli_list` function from the :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` 
module to generate random Paulis. This returns ``num_samples`` Paulis, each 
across ``meas_nc`` qubits.

Now we construct the circuits by composing the original circuit with a Pauli frame then
adding a measurement at the end only to the measurement qubits. Metadata containing
the classical measurement register and the applied Pauli is added to 
each of the circuits to tell the analysis class how to restore the original results.
To make restoration easier, we store Paulis in the 
:class:`x symplectic form <qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable>` in ``metadata["rm_sig"]``
so we know whether to apply a bit flip to each bit of the result 
(the phase is not important for our purposes).

.. jupyter-input::

    ...

        # Construct circuits
        circuits = []
        orig_metadata = self._circuit.metadata or {}
        for pauli in paulis:
            name = f"{self._circuit.name}_{str(pauli)}"
            circ = QuantumCircuit(
                self.num_qubits, circ_nc + meas_nc,
                name=name
            )
            # Append original circuit
            circ.compose(
                self._circuit, circ_qubits, circ_clbits, inplace=True
            )

            # Add Pauli frame
            circ.compose(pauli, meas_qubits, inplace=True)

            # Add final measurement
            circ.measure(meas_qubits, meas_clbits)

            circ.metadata = orig_metadata.copy()
            circ.metadata["rm_bits"] = meas_clbits
            circ.metadata["rm_frame"] = str(pauli)
            circ.metadata["rm_sig"] = pauli.x.astype(int).tolist()
            circuits.append(circ)
        return circuits

Now we write the analysis class, overriding ``_run_analysis`` as described above. We
loop over each circuit to process the output bitstring. Since we're using default level 
2 data, we access it with the ``counts`` key. We use the circuit metadata to calculate the bitwise XOR mask from the Pauli
signature to restore the output to what it should be without the random Pauli frame
at the end. We make a new :class:`.AnalysisResultData` object since we're rewriting the 
counts from the original experiment.

.. note::

    As you may find here, circuit metadata is mainly used to generate a structured data
    in the analysis class for convenience of result handling.
    A metadata supplied to a particular circuit should appear in the corresponding
    experiment result data dictionary stored in the experiment data.
    If you attach large amount of metadata which is not expected to be used in the analysis,
    the metadata just unnecessarily increases the job payload memory footprint,
    and it prevents your experiment class from scaling in qubit size through
    the composite experiment tooling.
    If you still want to store some experiment setting, which is common to all circuits
    or irrelevant to the analysis, use the experiment metadata instead.

.. jupyter-input::

    from qiskit_experiments.framework import BaseAnalysis, AnalysisResultData

    class RandomizedMeasurementAnalysis(BaseAnalysis):
        """Analysis for randomized measurement experiment."""

        def _run_analysis(self, experiment_data):
            
            combined_counts = {}
            for datum in experiment_data.data():
                # Get counts
                counts = datum["counts"]
                num_bits = len(next(iter(counts)))

                # Get metadata
                metadata = datum["metadata"]
                clbits = metadata["rm_bits"]
                sig = metadata["rm_sig"]

                # Construct full signature
                full_sig = num_bits * [0]
                for bit, val in zip(clbits, sig):
                    full_sig[bit] = val
                
                # Combine dicts
                for key, val in counts.items():
                    bitstring = self._swap_bitstring(key, full_sig)
                    if bitstring in combined_counts:
                        combined_counts[bitstring] += val
                    else:
                        combined_counts[bitstring] = val
                        
            result = AnalysisResultData("counts", combined_counts)
            return [result], []

This is the helper function we're using to apply the XOR mask and flip the bitstring
output if the Pauli corresponding to that bit has a nonzero signature.

To test our code, we first simulate a noisy backend with asymmetric readout error.

.. note::
    This tutorial requires the :external+qiskit_aer:doc:`qiskit-aer <index>` package for simulations.
    You can install it with ``python -m pip install qiskit-aer``.


.. jupyter-execute::

  from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator, noise

  backend_ideal = AerSimulator()

  # Backend with asymmetric readout error
  p0g1 = 0.3
  p1g0 = 0.05
  noise_model = noise.NoiseModel()
  noise_model.add_all_qubit_readout_error([[1 - p1g0, p1g0], [p0g1, 1 - p0g1]])
  noise_backend = AerSimulator(noise_model=noise_model)

Let's use a GHZ circuit as the input:

.. jupyter-execute::

    # GHZ Circuit
    nq = 4
    qc = QuantumCircuit(nq)
    qc.h(0)
    for i in range(1, nq):
        qc.cx(i-1, i)
    
    qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")

Check that the experiment is appending a random Pauli and measurements as expected:

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Experiment parameters
    total_shots = 100000
    num_samples = 50
    shots = total_shots // num_samples

    # Run ideal randomized meas experiment
    exp = RandomizedMeasurement(qc, num_samples=num_samples)
    exp.circuits()[0].draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")

We now run the experiment with a GHZ circuit on an ideal backend, which produces nearly
perfect symmetrical results between :math:`|0000\rangle` and :math:`|1111\rangle`:

.. jupyter-execute::

    expdata_ideal = exp.run(AerSimulator(), shots=shots)
    counts_ideal = expdata_ideal.analysis_results("counts").value
    print(counts_ideal)

Repeat the experiment on the backend with readout error and compare with results
from running GHZ circuit itself:

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Run noisy randomized meas experiment with readout error
    expdata_noise = exp.run(noise_backend, shots=shots)
    counts_noise = expdata_noise.analysis_results("counts").value

    # Run noisy simulation of the original circuit without randomization
    meas_circ = qc.copy()
    meas_circ.measure_all()
    result = noise_backend.run(meas_circ, shots=total_shots).result()
    counts_direct = result.get_counts(0)

    from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

    # Plot counts, ideally randomized one should be more symmetric in noise
    # than direct one with asymmetric readout error
    plot_histogram([counts_ideal, counts_direct, counts_noise],
                legend=["Ideal",
                        "Asymmetric meas error (Direct)",
                        "Asymmetric meas error (Randomized)"])

For a GHZ state, we expect a symmetric noise model to also produce symmetric readout
results. The asymmetric measurement of the original circuit on this backend (Direct on
the plot legend) has been successfully symmetrized by the application of randomized
measurement (Randomized on the plot legend).

Note that since this experiment tracks the original and added classical registers, it is
possible for the original circuit to have its own mid-circuit measurements that would be
unaffected by the added randomized measurements, which use its own classical registers:

.. jupyter-execute::

    qc = QuantumCircuit(nq)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.measure_all()
    qc.barrier()
    for i in range(1, nq):
        qc.cx(i-1, i)

    exp = RandomizedMeasurement(qc, num_samples=num_samples)
    exp.circuits()[0].draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
