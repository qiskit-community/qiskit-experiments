A :math:`T_1` experiment
========================

In a :math:`T_1` experiment, we measure an excited qubit after a delay.
Due to decoherence processes (e.g. amplitude damping channel), it is
possible that, at the time of measurement, after the delay, the qubit
will not be excited anymore. The larger the delay time is, the more
likely is the qubit to fall to the ground state. The goal of the
experiment is to characterize the decay rate of the qubit towards the
ground state.

We start by fixing a delay time :math:`t` and a number of shots
:math:`s`. Then, by repeating :math:`s` times the procedure of exciting
the qubit, waiting, and measuring, we estimate the probability to
measure :math:`|1\rangle` after the delay. We repeat this process for a
set of delay times, resulting in a set of probability estimates.

In the absence of state preparation and measurement errors, the
probability to measure \|1> after time :math:`t` is :math:`e^{-t/T_1}`,
for a constant :math:`T_1` (the coherence time), which is our target
number. Since state preparation and measurement errors do exist, the
qubit’s decay towards the ground state assumes the form
:math:`Ae^{-t/T_1} + B`, for parameters :math:`A, T_1`, and :math:`B`,
which we deduce form the probability estimates. To this end, the
:math:`T_1` experiment internally calls the ``curve_fit`` method of
``scipy.optimize``.

The following code demonstrates a basic run of a :math:`T_1` experiment
for qubit 0.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.qobj.utils import MeasLevel
    from qiskit_experiments.framework import ParallelExperiment
    from qiskit_experiments.library import T1
    from qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.analysis.t1_analysis import T1KerneledAnalysis

    # A T1 simulator
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeVigo
    from qiskit.providers.aer import AerSimulator
    from qiskit.providers.aer.noise import NoiseModel

    # A kerneled data simulator
    from qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_backend import MockIQBackend
    from qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_helpers import MockIQT1Helper
    
    # Create a pure relaxation noise model for AerSimulator
    noise_model = NoiseModel.from_backend(
        FakeVigo(), thermal_relaxation=True, gate_error=False, readout_error=False
    )
    
    # Create a fake backend simulator
    backend = AerSimulator.from_backend(FakeVigo(), noise_model=noise_model)
    
    # Look up target T1 of qubit-0 from device properties
    qubit0_t1 = backend.properties().t1(0)
    
    # Time intervals to wait before measurement
    delays = np.arange(1e-6, 3 * qubit0_t1, 3e-5)
    # Create an experiment for qubit 0
    # with the specified time intervals
    exp = T1(qubit=0, delays=delays)
    
    # Set scheduling method so circuit is scheduled for delay noise simulation
    exp.set_transpile_options(scheduling_method='asap')
    
    # Run the experiment circuits and analyze the result
    exp_data = exp.run(backend=backend, seed_simulator=101).block_for_results()
    
    # Print the result
    display(exp_data.figure(0))
    for result in exp_data.analysis_results():
        print(result)


Parallel :math:`T_1` experiments on multiple qubits
---------------------------------------------------

To measure :math:`T_1` of multiple qubits in the same experiment, we
create a parallel experiment:

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Create a parallel T1 experiment
    parallel_exp = ParallelExperiment([T1(qubit=i, delays=delays) for i in range(2)])
    parallel_exp.set_transpile_options(scheduling_method='asap')
    parallel_data = parallel_exp.run(backend, seed_simulator=101).block_for_results()
    
    # View result data
    for result in parallel_data.analysis_results():
        print(result)


Viewing sub experiment data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The experiment data returned from a batched experiment also contains
individual experiment data for each sub experiment which can be accessed
using ``child_data``

.. jupyter-execute::

    # Print sub-experiment data
    for i, sub_data in enumerate(parallel_data.child_data()):
        print("Component experiment",i)
        display(sub_data.figure(0))
        for result in sub_data.analysis_results():
            print(result)

:math:`T_1` experiments with kerneled measurement
---------------------------------------------------
:math:`T_1` experiment can also be done with kerneled measurement.
If we will set the running option `meas_level=MeasLevel.KERNELED`, the
job will not discriminate the data and will not label it. In T1 experiment,
as we know that in :math:`P(1|t=0)=1`, we will add measurement for delay=0
and for extreme delay. In this configuration we know that the data starts from
a point [I,Q] that is close to a logical value '1' and ends at a point [I,Q]
that is close to a logical value '0'. Beside that, We will need to use analysis
option to normalize the output.


.. jupyter-execute::

    # Experiment
    ns = 1e-9
    mu = 1e-6

    # qubit properties
    t1 = [45 * mu, 45 * mu]
    t2 = [value/2 for value in t1]

    # we will guess that our guess is 10% off the exact value of t1 for qubit 0.
    t1_estimated_shift = t1[0]/10

    # We use log space for the delays because of the noise properties.
	delays = np.logspace(1, 11, num=20, base=np.exp(1))
    delays = [delay * ns for delay in delays]

    # adding to the circuit 0 delay and long delays to help the curve fitting
    delays = np.insert(delays, 0, 0)
    delays = np.append(delays, [t1[0]*2, t1[0]*3, t1[0]*4, t1[0]*5])

    num_qubits = 2
    num_shots = 2048

    backend = MockIQBackend(
		MockIQT1HelperTemp(t1=t1, iq_cluster_centers=[((-5.0, -4.0), (-5.0, 4.0)), ((3.0, 1.0), (5.0, -3.0))]
						   , iq_cluster_width=[1.0, 2.0])
	)

    # Creating a T1 experiment
	expT1_kerneled = T1(0, delays)
    expT1_kerneled.analysis = T1KerneledAnalysis()
    expT1_kerneled.analysis.set_options(p0={"amp": 1, "tau": t1[0] + t1_estimated_shift, "base": 0})

    # Running the experiment
    expdataT1_kerneled = expT1_kerneled.run(backend=backend, meas_return="avg",
                                            meas_level=MeasLevel.KERNELED,
                                            shots=num_shots).block_for_results()

    # Displaying results
    display(expdataT1_kerneled.figure(0))
    for result in expdataT1_kerneled.analysis_results():
        print(result)
