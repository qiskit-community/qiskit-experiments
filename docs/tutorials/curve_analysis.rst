Curve Analysis: Fitting your data
=================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis

For most experiments, we are interested in fitting our results to a pre-defined 
mathematical model.
The Curve Analysis module provides the analysis base class for a variety of experiments with
a single experimental parameter sweep. Analysis subclasses can override
several class attributes to customize the behavior from data processing to post-processing,
including providing systematic initial guesses for parameters tailored to the experiment.
Here we describe how the Curve Analysis module works and how you can create new 
analyses that inherit from the base class.


.. _curve_analysis_overview:

Curve Analysis overview
-----------------------

The base class :class:`.CurveAnalysis` implements the multi-objective optimization on
different sets of experiment results. A single experiment can define sub-experiments
consisting of multiple circuits which are tagged with common metadata,
and curve analysis sorts the experiment results based on the circuit metadata.

This is an example showing the abstract data flow of a typical curve analysis experiment:

.. figure:: images/curve_analysis_structure.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center
    :class: no-scaled-link

Here the experiment runs two subsets of experiments, namely, series A and series B.
The analysis defines corresponding fit models :math:`f_A(x_A)` and :math:`f_B(x_B)`.
Data extraction function in the analysis creates two datasets, :math:`(x_A, y_A)`
for the series A and :math:`(x_B, y_B)` for the series B, from the experiment data.
Optionally, the curve analysis can fix certain parameters during the fitting.
In this example, :math:`p_1 = v` remains unchanged during the fitting.

The curve analysis aims at solving the following optimization problem:

.. math::

    \Theta_{\mbox{opt}} = \arg\min_{\Theta_{\rm fit}} \sigma^{-2} (F(X, \Theta)-Y)^2,

where :math:`F` is the composite objective function defined on the full experiment data
:math:`(X, Y)`, where :math:`X = x_A \oplus x_B` and :math:`Y = y_A \oplus y_B`.
This objective function can be described by two fit functions as follows.

.. math::

    F(X, \Theta) = f_A(x_A, \theta_A) \oplus f_B(x_B, \theta_B).

The solver conducts the least square curve fitting against this objective function
and returns the estimated parameters :math:`\Theta_{\mbox{opt}}`
that minimize the reduced chi-squared value.
The parameters to be evaluated are :math:`\Theta = \Theta_{\rm fit} \cup \Theta_{\rm fix}`,
where :math:`\Theta_{\rm fit} = \theta_A \cup \theta_B`.
Since series A and B share the parameters in this example, :math:`\Theta_{\rm fit} = \{p_0, p_2\}`,
and the fixed parameters are :math:`\Theta_{\rm fix} = \{ p_1 \}` as mentioned.
Thus, :math:`\Theta = \{ p_0, p_1, p_2 \}`.

Experiment for each series can perform individual parameter sweep for :math:`x_A` and
:math:`x_B`, and experiment data yields outcomes :math:`y_A` and :math:`y_B`, which might
be of different size. Data processing functions may also compute :math:`\sigma_A` and
:math:`\sigma_B`, which are the uncertainty of outcomes arising from the sampling error
or measurement error.

More specifically, the curve analysis defines the following data model.

- Model: Definition of a single curve that is a function of a reserved parameter "x".

- Group: List of models. Fit functions defined under the same group must share the
  fit parameters. Fit functions in the group are simultaneously fit to
  generate a single fit result.

Once the group is assigned, a curve analysis instance builds
a proper internal optimization routine.
Finally, the analysis outputs a set of :class:`.AnalysisResultData` entries
for important fit outcomes along with a single figure of the fit curves
with the measured data points.

With this base class, a developer can avoid writing boilerplate code in
various curve analyses subclasses and can quickly write up
the analysis code for a particular experiment.


.. _curve_analysis_define_group:

Defining new models
-------------------

The fit model is defined by the `LMFIT`_ ``Model``. If you are familiar with this
package, you can skip this section. The LMFIT package manages complicated fit functions
and offers several algorithms to solve non-linear least-square problems. Curve Analysis
delegates the core fitting functionality to this package.

You can intuitively write the definition of a model, as shown below:

.. jupyter-input::

    import lmfit

    models = [
        lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
            expr="amp * exp(-alpha * x) + base",
            name="exp_decay",
        )
    ]

Note that ``x`` is the reserved name to represent a parameter
that is scanned during the experiment. In above example, the fit function
consists of three parameters (``amp``, ``alpha``, ``base``), and ``exp`` indicates
a universal function in Python's math module.
Alternatively, you can take a callable to define the model object.

.. jupyter-input::

    import lmfit
    import numpy as np

    def exp_decay(x, amp, alpha, base):
        return amp * np.exp(-alpha * x) + base

    models = [lmfit.Model(func=exp_decay)]

See the `LMFIT`_ documentation for detailed user guide. They also provide preset models.

If the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` object is instantiated with multiple models,
it internally builds a cost function to simultaneously minimize the residuals of
all fit functions.
The names of the parameters in the fit function are important since they are used
in the analysis result, and potentially in your experiment database as a fit result.

Here is another example on how to implement a multi-objective optimization task:

.. jupyter-input::

    import lmfit

    models = [
        lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
            expr="amp * exp(-alpha1 * x) + base",
            name="my_experiment1",
        ),
        lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
            expr="amp * exp(-alpha2 * x) + base",
            name="my_experiment2",
        ),
    ]

In addition, you need to provide ``data_subfit_map`` analysis option, which may look like

.. jupyter-input::

    data_subfit_map = {
        "my_experiment1": {"tag": 1},
        "my_experiment2": {"tag": 2},
    }

This option specifies the metadata of your experiment circuit
that is tied to the fit model. If multiple models are provided without this option,
the curve fitter cannot prepare the data for fitting.
In this model, you have four parameters (``amp``, ``alpha1``, ``alpha2``, ``base``)
and the two curves share ``amp`` (``base``) for the amplitude (baseline) in
the exponential decay function.
Here one should expect the experiment data will have two classes of data with metadata
``"tag": 1`` and ``"tag": 2`` for ``my_experiment1`` and ``my_experiment2``, respectively.

By using this model, you can flexibly set up your fit model. Here is another example:

.. jupyter-input::

    import lmfit

    models = [
        lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
            expr="amp * cos(2 * pi * freq * x + phi) + base",
            name="my_experiment1",
        ),
        lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
            expr="amp * sin(2 * pi * freq * x + phi) + base",
            name="my_experiment2",
        ),
    ]

You have the same set of fit parameters in the two models, but now you fit two datasets
with different trigonometric functions.

.. _LMFIT: https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/intro.html

.. _curve_analysis_fixed_param:

Fitting with fixed parameters
-----------------------------

You can also keep certain parameters unchanged during the fitting by specifying the
parameter names in the analysis option ``fixed_parameters``. This feature is useful
especially when you want to define a subclass of a particular analysis class.

.. jupyter-input::

    class AnalysisA(CurveAnalysis):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(
                models=[
                    lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
                        expr="amp * exp(-alpha * x) + base", name="my_model"
                    )
                ]
            )

    class AnalysisB(AnalysisA):

        @classmethod
        def _default_options(cls) -> Options:
            options = super()._default_options()
            options.fixed_parameters = {"amp": 3.0}

            return options

The parameter specified in ``fixed_parameters`` is excluded from the fitting.
This code will give you identical fit model to the one defined in the following class:

.. jupyter-input::

    class AnalysisB(CurveAnalysis):

        super().__init__(
            models=[
                lmfit.models.ExpressionModel(
                    expr="3.0 * exp(-alpha * x) + base", name="my_model"
                )
            ]
        )

However, note that you can also inherit other features, e.g. the algorithm to
generate initial guesses for parameters, from the ``AnalysisA`` class in the first example.
On the other hand, in the latter case, you need to manually copy and paste
every logic defined in ``AnalysisA``.

.. _data_management_with_scatter_table:

Managing intermediate data
--------------------------

:class:`.ScatterTable` is the single source of truth for the data used in curve
fit analysis.
Curve analysis primarily involves working with `curves`, which consist of a
series of x and y values along with a series of standard error values for the y
values.
:class:`.ScatterTable` gathers all of the data from all of the curves together
into a single table with one row for each x, y value.

Since analysis can involve several curves, a system is needed for labeling them.
:class:`.ScatterTable` uses three labels for identifying curves.
In order of narrowest to broadest scope, these labels are `series` (represented
by `series_id` and `series_name` columns in the table; see below), `category`,
and `analysis`.

* A `series` is a set of x and y values for which the y values are expected to
  follow a single function of x with fixed values for any other parameters of
  the function.
  For example, a series could consist of x and correpsonding y values for the
  model ``a * cos(w * x)`` for specific ``a`` and ``w`` values.
  However, if the data set had values for ``a = 1`` and ``a = 0.5``, it would
  contain two series rather than one.
  In the :class:`.ScatterTable`, a series is specified with the `series_id`
  (integer) and `series_name` (string) columns (see below).
  Some methods like :meth:`.ScatterTable.filter` accept `series` as an argument
  that could be either `series_name` or `series_id` so we use `series` when the
  distinction is not important.

* A `category` is a label for a group of series that correspond to a particular
  stage of processing.
  For example, the series data received from quantum circuit execution and
  prepared for fitting could be labeled with the category `"formatted"` while
  the series data produced using fitted model parameters could be labeled with
  the category `"fitted"`.

* The `analysis` label holds the name of the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclass
  associated with each series.
  For a simple :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclass, all series would have the same
  `analysis` label.
  However, for :class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis`, multiple
  :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclasses can be associated with a single
  experiment, and this label can help distinguish curves that have the same
  `series` and `category`.

Here we review the default behavior of :class:`.CurveAnalysis` and
:class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis` regarding the assignment of `series_id`,
`series_name`, `category`, and `analysis`.

The data set provided to the analysis by :meth:`.ExperimentData.data` is
processed using the :class:`.DataProcessor` set with the `data_processor`
analysis option.
When no `data_processor` option is set, the default behavior is to convert
counts to probability for level 2 data.
For level 1 data, the default behavior is to project the complex values to real
values using singular value decomposition, average the values if individual
shot data were returned, and then normalize the results.
This processed data set is then given the `category` `"raw"`.
This data set is classified into series using the ``data_subfit_map`` analysis
option as described above with the `series_name` set to the matched key in
``data_subfit_map`` (which matches a fit model name) and the `series_id` set to
the corresponding index for that fit model in the :attr:`.CurveAnalysis.models`
list.
If the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclass has a single unnamed model, the
`series_name` is set to `model-0`.
If a data point does not match any key, it is given a null value for
`series_name` and `series_id`.
These operations are performed in the
``CurveAnalysis._run_data_processing()`` method.

The `"raw"` data are then fed into the ``CurveAnalysis._format_data`` method
for which the default behavior is to average all of the y values within a
series with the same x value.
The formatted data are added to the :class:`.ScatterTable` with the same
`series` labels and the category of `"formatted"`.
The `"formatted"` data set is then queried from the :class:`.ScatterTable` and
passed to the ``CurveAnalysis._run_curve_fit()`` method which performs the
fitting.
Afterward new curves for each series are generated using the fit models and
fitting parameters and added to the :class:`.ScatterTable` with the category
`"fitted"`.

The preceding steps are performed by :class:`.CurveAnalysis` and all of the
entries in the :class:`.ScatterTable` are given the name of the analysis class
for the `analysis` column.
For :class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis`, the same procedure is repeated for each
component :class:`.CurveAnalysis` class and the series are given the name of
that class for the `analysis` column, so the results from different component
analysis classes can be distinguished.

Note that :meth:`.ScatterTable.add_row` allows for curve analysis subclasses to
set arbitrary values for `series_name`, `series_id`, and `category` as
appropriate.
An analysis class may override some of the default curve analysis methods and
add additional `category` labels or define other `series` not named after a
model.
For example, :class:`.StarkRamseyXYAmpScanAnalysis` defines four `series`
labels in its ``data_subfit_map`` option (``Xpos``, ``Ypos``, ``Xneg``,
``Yneg``) but only two models (``FREQpos``, ``FREQneg``) whose names do not
match the series labels.
It does this by overriding the ``CurveData._format_data()`` method and adding
its own series to the :class:`.ScatterTable` with series labels to match its
fit model names (by combining ``Xpos``  and ``Ypos`` series data into a
``FREQpos`` series and similary for the series with names ending with ``neg``).
It sets a custom category, `"freq"`, for its series but also sets the
``fit_category`` analysis option to `"freq"` so that normal curve fitting is
performed on this custom ``"freq"`` series data.

The (`series`, `category`, `analysis`) triplet can be used to extract data
points that belong to a particular categorized series. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    mini_table = table.filter(series="my_experiment1", category="raw", analysis="AnalysisA")
    mini_x = mini_table.x
    mini_y = mini_table.y

This operation is equivalent to

.. code-block:: python

    mini_x = table.xvals(series="my_experiment1", category="raw", analysis="AnalysisA")
    mini_y = table.yvals(series="my_experiment1", category="raw", analysis="AnalysisA")

When a :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclass only has a single model and the table
is created from a single analysis instance, the `series_id` and `analysis` are
trivial, and you only need to specify the `category` to get subset data of
interest.

The full description of :class:`.ScatterTable` columns is as follows:

- `xval`: Parameter scanned in the experiment. This value must be defined in the circuit metadata.
- `yval`: Nominal part of the outcome. The outcome is, for example, an expectation value
  computed from the experiment results with a data processor.
- `yerr`: Standard error of the outcome, which is mainly due to sampling error.
- `series_name`: Human readable name of the data series. This is defined by the ``data_subfit_map`` option in the :class:`.CurveAnalysis`.
- `series_id`: Integer corresponding to the name of data series. This number is automatically assigned.
- `category`: A category that could group several series. This is defined by a
  developer of the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclass and usually corresponds to
  a stage of data processing like `"raw"` or `"formatted"`.
- `shots`: Number of measurement shots used to acquire a data point. This value can be defined in the circuit metadata.
- `analysis`: The name of the curve analysis instance that generated a data point.

:class:`.ScatterTable` helps an analysis developer to write a custom analysis class
without the overhead of complex data management.
It also helps end-users to retrieve and reuse the intermediate data from an
experiment in their custom fitting workflow outside our curve fitting
framework.
Note that a :class:`ScatterTable` instance may be saved in the :class:`.ExperimentData` as an artifact.
See the :doc:`Artifacts how-to </howtos/artifacts>` for more information.


.. _curve_analysis_workflow:

Curve Analysis workflow
-----------------------

.. warning::

    :class:`CurveData` dataclass is replaced with :class:`.ScatterTable` dataframe.
    This class will be deprecated and removed in the future release.

Typically curve analysis performs fitting as follows.
This workflow is defined in the method :meth:`CurveAnalysis._run_analysis`.

1. Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Curve analysis calls the :meth:`_initialization` method, where it initializes
some internal states and optionally populates analysis options
with the input experiment data.
In some cases it may train the data processor with fresh outcomes,
or dynamically generate the fit models (``self._models``) with fresh analysis options.
A developer can override this method to perform initialization of analysis-specific variables.

2. Data processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Curve analysis calls the :meth:`_run_data_processing` method, where
the data processor in the analysis option is internally called.
This consumes input experiment results and creates the :class:`.ScatterTable` dataframe.
This table may look like:

.. jupyter-input::

    table = analysis._run_data_processing(experiment_data.data())
    print(table)

.. jupyter-output::

        xval      yval      yerr  series_name  series_id  category  shots     analysis
    0    0.1  0.153659  0.011258            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    1    0.1  0.590732  0.015351            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    2    0.1  0.315610  0.014510            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    3    0.1  0.376098  0.015123            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    4    0.2  0.937073  0.007581            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    5    0.2  0.323415  0.014604            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    6    0.2  0.538049  0.015565            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    7    0.2  0.530244  0.015581            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    8    0.3  0.143902  0.010958            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    9    0.3  0.261951  0.013727            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    10   0.3  0.830732  0.011707            A          0      raw    1024   MyAnalysis
    11   0.3  0.874634  0.010338            B          1      raw    1024   MyAnalysis

where the experiment consists of two subset series A and B, and the experiment parameter (xval)
is scanned from 0.1 to 0.3 in each subset. In this example, the experiment is run twice
for each condition.
See :ref:`data_management_with_scatter_table` for the details of columns.

3. Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, the processed dataset is converted into another format suited for the fitting.
By default, the formatter takes average of the outcomes in the processed dataset
over the same x values, followed by the sorting in the ascending order of x values.
This allows the analysis to easily estimate the slope of the curves to
create algorithmic initial guess of fit parameters.
A developer can inject extra data processing, for example, filtering, smoothing,
or elimination of outliers for better fitting.
The new `series_id` is given here so that its value corresponds to the fit model index
defined in this analysis class. This index mapping is done based upon the correspondence of
the `series_name` and the fit model name.

This is done by calling :meth:`_format_data` method.
This may return new scatter table object with the addition of rows like the following below.

.. jupyter-input::

    table = analysis._format_data(table)
    print(table)

.. jupyter-output::

        xval      yval      yerr  series_name  series_id   category  shots     analysis
    ...
    12   0.1  0.234634  0.009183            A          0  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis
    13   0.2  0.737561  0.008656            A          0  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis
    14   0.3  0.487317  0.008018            A          0  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis
    15   0.1  0.483415  0.010774            B          1  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis
    16   0.2  0.426829  0.010678            B          1  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis
    17   0.3  0.568293  0.008592            B          1  formatted   2048   MyAnalysis

The default :meth:`_format_data` method adds its output data with the category "formatted".
This category name must be also specified in the analysis option ``fit_category``.
If overriding this method to do additional processing after the default formatting,
the ``fit_category`` analysis option can be set to choose a different category name to use to
select the data to pass to the fitting routine.
The (xval, yval) value in each row is passed to the corresponding fit model object
to compute residual values for the least square optimization.

3. Fitting
^^^^^^^^^^

Curve analysis calls the :meth:`_run_curve_fit` method with the formatted subset of the scatter table.
This internally calls :meth:`_generate_fit_guesses` to prepare
the initial guess and parameter boundary with respect to the formatted dataset.
Developers usually override this method to provide better initial guesses
tailored to the defined fit model or type of the associated experiment.
See :ref:`curve_analysis_init_guess` for more details.
Developers can also override the entire :meth:`_run_curve_fit` method to apply
custom fitting algorithms. This method must return a :class:`.CurveFitResult` dataclass.

4. Post processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Curve analysis runs several postprocessing against the fit outcome.
When the fit is successful, it calls :meth:`._create_analysis_results` to create the :class:`.AnalysisResultData` objects
for the fitting parameters of interest. A developer can inject custom code to
compute custom quantities based on the raw fit parameters.
See :ref:`curve_analysis_results` for details.
Afterwards, fit curves are computed with the fit models and optimal parameters, and the scatter table is
updated with the computed (x, y) values. This dataset is stored under the `"fitted"` category.

Finally, the :meth:`._create_figures` method is called with the entire scatter table data
to initialize the curve plotter instance accessible via the :attr:`~.CurveAnalysis.plotter` attribute.
The visualization is handed over to the :doc:`Visualization </tutorials/visualization>` module,
which provides a standardized image format for curve fit results.
A developer can overwrite this method to draw custom images.

.. _curve_analysis_init_guess:

Providing initial guesses
-------------------------

Fitting without initial guesses for parameters often results in a bad fit. Users can
provide initial guesses and boundaries for the fit parameters through analysis options
``p0`` and ``bounds``. These values are the dictionary keyed on the parameter name, and
one can get the list of parameters with the :attr:`CurveAnalysis.parameters`. Each
boundary value can be a tuple of floats representing minimum and maximum values.

Apart from user provided guesses, the analysis can systematically generate those values
with the method :meth:`_generate_fit_guesses`, which is called with the :class:`CurveData`
dataclass. If the analysis contains multiple model definitions, we can get the subset
of curve data with :meth:`.CurveData.get_subset_of` using the name of the series. A
developer can implement the algorithm to generate initial guesses and boundaries by
using this curve data object, which will be provided to the fitter. Note that there are
several common initial guess estimators available in :mod:`curve_analysis.guess`.

The :meth:`_generate_fit_guesses` also receives the :class:`.FitOptions` instance
``user_opt``, which contains user provided guesses and boundaries. This is a
dictionary-like object consisting of sub-dictionaries for initial guess ``.p0``,
boundary ``.bounds``, and extra options for the fitter. See the API
documentation for available options.

The :class:`.FitOptions` class implements convenient method :meth:`set_if_empty` to manage
conflict with user provided values, i.e. user provided values have higher priority,
thus systematically generated values cannot override user values.

.. jupyter-input::

    def _generate_fit_guesses(self, user_opt, curve_data):

        opt1 = user_opt.copy()
        opt1.p0.set_if_empty(p1=3)
        opt1.bounds = set_if_empty(p1=(0, 10))
        opt1.add_extra_options(method="lm")

        opt2 = user_opt.copy()
        opt2.p0.set_if_empty(p1=4)

        return [opt1, opt2]

Here you created two options with different ``p1`` values. If multiple options are
returned like this, the :meth:`_run_curve_fit` method attempts to fit with all provided
options and finds the best outcome with the minimum reduced chi-square value. When the
fit model contains some parameter that cannot be easily estimated from the curve data,
you can create multiple options by varying the initial guess to let the fitter find
the most reasonable parameters to explain the model. This allows you to avoid analysis
failure with the poor initial guesses.

.. _curve_analysis_quality:

Evaluate Fit Quality
--------------------

A subclass can override :meth:`_evaluate_quality` method to
provide an algorithm to evaluate quality of the fitting.
This method is called with the :class:`.CurveFitResult` object which contains
fit parameters and the reduced chi-squared value,
in addition to the several statistics on the fitting.
Qiskit Experiments often uses the empirical criterion chi-squared < 3 as a good fitting.


.. _curve_analysis_results:

Curve Analysis Results
----------------------

Once the best fit parameters are found, the :meth:`_create_analysis_results` method is
called with the same :class:`.CurveFitResult` object.

If you want to create an analysis result entry for the particular parameter,
you can override the analysis options ``result_parameters``.
By using :class:`ParameterRepr` representation, you can rename the parameter in the entry.

.. jupyter-input::

    from qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis import ParameterRepr

    def _default_options(cls) -> Options:
        options = super()._default_options()
        options.result_parameters = [ParameterRepr("p0", "amp", "Hz")]

        return options

Here the first argument ``p0`` is the target parameter defined in the series definition,
``amp`` is the representation of ``p0`` in the result entry,
and ``Hz`` is the optional string for the unit of the value if available.

In addition to returning the fit parameters, you can also compute new quantities
by combining multiple fit parameters.
This can be done by overriding the :meth:`_create_analysis_results` method.

.. jupyter-input::

    from qiskit_experiments.framework import AnalysisResultData

    def _create_analysis_results(self, fit_data, quality, **metadata):

        outcomes = super()._create_analysis_results(fit_data, **metadata)

        p0 = fit_data.ufloat_params["p0"]
        p1 = fit_data.ufloat_params["p1"]

        extra_entry = AnalysisResultData(
            name="p01",
            value=p0 * p1,
            quality=quality,
            extra=metadata,
        )
        outcomes.append(extra_entry)

        return outcomes

Note that both ``p0`` and ``p1`` are `UFloat`_ objects consisting of
a nominal value and an error value which assumes the standard deviation.
Since this object natively supports error propagation,
you don't have to manually recompute the error of the new value.
